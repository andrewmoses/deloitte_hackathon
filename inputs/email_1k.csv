Folks-
Just a reminder that if you will be including overheads, slides, handouts,
or any other info as part of your speech, discussion, or panel please send
said info to me via email or fax ASAP so that I can make adequate copies for
the Group. If you are so inclined as to make your own copies I would
recommend making 90 copies to cover all attendees.

Also, we will be providing an overhead projector and an LCD projector (for
power point presentations) for your use. If you require some other type of
A/V equipment please let me know ASAP.

Thanks to you all for agreeing to be a part of our Retreat. I expect it to
be quite an event. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Thanks again,
Delaney"

To: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT
cc: Richard Leibert/HOU/EES@EES 
Subject: DASH FOR RIOGEN MERCHANT (AKA ""ELECTROBOLT"")

Rick, I was provided a copy of the DASH at 6:30 PM last evening and asked to 
sign off soonest.  My comments follow:

Cost:  the DASH is incorrect.  EECC has provided both a cost - plus price and 
a guaranteed price.
EECC has provided a NEPCO-guaranted price of $215MM.
EECC has indicated that it's estimate of actual costs is most likely $205MM.  
We indicated this cost estimate was somewhat conservative.  Since last week, 
the cost estimate has been further revised to $202MM.  It is unlikely that 
the actual costs of the project will be significantly less than $202MM.  
$202MM represents a cost estimate with the Owners maintaining the risk of 
overruns and schedule.  This would require the Owner to maintain a 
contingency in his proforma above the most likely expected cost of $202MM.
After providing the above information to the Developer, the Developer was 
going to take a look at the carrying cost of turbines which were inside this 
estimate; I have no update on whether the turbine price changed from the 
numbers I saw last week.
Schedule:  Neither my team nor I had seen the provisions of termination by 
Petrobras, as stated in the DASH, prior to last evening.  The ability of 
Petrobras to terminate at April 30, 2002 if the project is not completed due 
to circumstances within Enron's controls, is an unlikely risk, but not 
totally impossible.  Further, the project is subject to a June 30, 2002, 
termination by Petrobras if the project is not completed due to force 
majeure.  This is considered more of an onerous risk.  It's not clear to me 
whether the requirement to complete the pipeline and bring gas to the project 
would be considered under Enron's control, considering that Enron is a 
partial Owner in CEG, the gas distribution pipeline company.
On the other hand, we have indicated that an October 31, 2001 start-up, is 
reasonable, based on a full NTP by January 1, and site access on February 1.  
If the schedule is constrained by the RAC recommendation to limit expenses to 
$15MM, the October 31, start-up could be at risk.
Performance:  The stated agreement with Petrobras for 365 megawatts (site 
condition) and an average net degraded heat rate of 9169 btu/kWH, appears 
correct, if it is LHV.
O&M Guarantee:  The DASH is not clear on what O&M availability guarantee 
Enron is prepared to sign with Petrobras.  I would suggest that OEC insure it 
agrees with any availability guarantees prior to Enron signing the Petrobras 
agreement.

Rick, sorry for this late feedback, but our system of coordination with the 
RAC needs improvement.  In the days when I worked with EI, EECC would provide 
to EI a written due diligence report direct, after checking the proforma 
against the PPA.  This was an Enron lesson-learned after years of 
experience.  The recent reorganizations have diluted this procedure.  I 
suggest I discuss with you how to improve our due diligence process.

Regards,

Larry

Subject: WINNING TICKET


Dear  State 
Lottery Commission,

??? I know I chose the  
winning numbers for Wednesday's Lotto drawing.? But
upon further  review, 
it appears the incorrect numbers appeared on my
ticket.
How  could this 
happen?? The root cause of this dilemma is the form I  filled
out to get 
my ticket.? The form is very confusing.? I  thought I 
was
choosing
one set of numbers, (the winning numbers), when  in reality I 
chose a
completely different set of numbers.? The  numbers and boxes on 
the form are
so close together, it's impossible to  determine which box to 
fill in for
which number.
??? I  checked with at least 3,000 
other people, and they all had the exact
same  problem.? I'm sure if you 
review the form I filled out, it will  become
very clear that I'm entitled to 
the money from Wednesday's  drawing.? Please
reply with the date, time, 
and location, for me to  collect the winnings due
to me.

Thank you for your assistance in this  
matter.

Al  
Gore

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

Thank you, Corp!

Friday's United Way Appreciation Lunch was great fun.  Team Corp and their amazing Lego structure, which won an award for being the Most United, made us proud.  Congratulations to all of the team members: Ed Coats, David Gorte, Bob Hermann, Amy Kim, Mark Palmer, Greek Rice, Chip Schneider, Jim Steffes, Mike Terraso, Dennis Vegas.

Now let's show all of Enron that Corp employees are as generous as we are bold, smart, ambitious and innovative.

At Friday's lunch, we received a little challenge from Stan Horton, CEO of Enron Transportation Services. He's betting homemade cookies that by close of business on Monday, August 13 ETS will have a higher percentage of their overall goal than all of the other business units. I do not want to be up all night baking chocolate chip cookies for Stan, so I think we need to accept his challenge and blow ETS, EWS and EES out of the water!

The good news is that to date, Corp has raised $506,743, which is about 65% of our total goal of $785,000. 

The bad news is that only 21% of Corp employees have participated in the campaign so far.

If you are part of that 21% that has already given to the United Way, THANK YOU.  Your contribution makes a difference right here in our community.

If you haven't made your contribution, you still have time.  Please log on to <http://home.enron.com> and click on the United Way link today to make your contribution.  You'll need your GIS number to make your contribution.  Your GIS number is an eight-digit number that starts with a 9.

If you don't have your GIS number and password or need assistance with keying in your contribution, please call Kathy Mayfield at ext. 3-3264.  

Please remember that contributions made last year don't automatically roll over to this year.  You'll need to log on and make another contribution this year.

Your contribution to the United Way has an impact on one out of every two lives in the Houston community.  Don't miss the opportunity to play a role in Building Houston's Future.

Subject: Description of UBS Deal
Importance: High


Louise --

I need to understand exactly what data is and what data is not being transferred from Enron to UBS.  If any of the data is viewed by FERC as being jurisdictional assets, than Enron would need to inform FERC of that transfer before the transfer.  Clearly, customer specific data will create more issues than generic market information.  I need to check what happens if you have deleted the counterparty names but still show detailed trading data.
 
Who can help me get a better handle on this on Monday?
 
Also, I understand the ""adoption"" by UBS of Enron contracts.  Initially I was under the impression that this was simply a ""review"".  Again, any transfer of a jurisdictional asset would result in a 203 application by Enron.  I have seen one draft of the Interim Agreement, but assume that you would do this for EEI and other physical contracts.  Am I right?
 
Thanks,
 
Jim

How would you describe (in terms that a regulator would understand) what is transfered to UBS?  I am asking because I want to make sure that I have a good grasp of what is going to UBS before our FERC pre-meeting.

My understanding is that we are providing software code to is used (a) for all backoffice applications and (b) for a trading platform.  Anything else?

Group,
I have purchased 8 mws from the service desk for Tuesday (04/10) in SP-15.  
We bought 8 mws from a service customer through the APX.  I have made the 
entries into CAPs for the purchase from APX.  I have inc'd load in ST-WBOM.  
Load will need to be dec'd and the energy sold off. You may want to  combine 
it with EES(or buy some mws to make it a whole piece to sell) and use NCPA to 
move it North.  Or maybe export it at Silverpeak.  The schedule is as 
follows.  8 mw, HE 1-24 on 04/10 in SP-15.  The price is $150 peak, and $100 
off peak.  Purchase from Services is #574640, and purchase from APX is 
#574629.  Please make any buy-resales and sales under ST-WBOM. 
Please call with any questions.

Thanks,
Bill

FYI.  Latest info is that large customers, some QF cogens, independent storage companies, and perhaps PG&E, will be filing separate comments supporting the Bilas decision to adopt the settlement.

As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to ""implement"" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with ""SoCal backbone
facilities"". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work ""relatively well"" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

Great news.  With respect to the Commissoners, I think it makes sense to go 
back through Ellen and ask if she could set up meetings with a few 
commissioners ater the staff briefing.

the 3rd floor?).  Susan has talked with Bill Albrecht.  He'll probably be
coming in on Wed. p.m. Steve, any ideas about a Commissioner strategy?
(invite them to attend, if the FERC folks agree; ask the FERC folks to do
the inviting; ask the FERC folks to help set up meetings afterwards or a
follow on if they like what we do and think it useful for Commissioners; try
to do a walkaround -- that is, offer to have Jerry, Bill, Susan visit
commissioners individually Friday a.m. after the course or Thursday a.m.
before the course?) Wendy

Bhash and I have already ordered pizza and beer for the grading festivities on
Friday 12/17.  (Actually, cappucinno's, but I thought you'd appreciate the
imagery of cheerful--albeit inaccurate--graders more.)

2. Also, classmates have suggested a number of web sites, and links have been
added to the class site. Be sure to understand the environmental and labor
rights critiques of the WTO.  We do not have time to discuss them in class, 
and
most business press presents largely the advantages of free trade.

See you soon,
- David

I'm not sure if this is automatic or if you have to actually do something to 
make sure it happens, but either way, THANK YOU!  Flying on this flight 
stinks and it would be even worse in the back of the bus!!  DF

Hi Mark. How are plans for this year's BEAR program? I wanted to forward an invitation to a community program I am chairing later this month. I thought this would be of interest for your legal team. We are working on CLE credits for this as well. Call if you need more details.

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

Hi Tana,

I need to know where crude/liquids financial trades for  Valero should be 
traded under.    I was reading the comments on Lotus Notes, and it seems that 
there was an assignment from Valero Gas Marketing L.P. to Valero Marketing & 
Supply Company;  then it seems that the natural gas financial  trades were 
assigned to PG&E.   Can you please check on this.  If the information on 
Lotus Notes is correct please change the ""Executed Master Agreeements"" list 
to read Valero Marketing & Supply Company (for crude/liquids trades).  
Currently the list reads Valero Gas Marketing L.P.

Thanks for your assistance,

Nidia

Please read the attached memo regarding the significant shift in the 
Commission's policy.   The policy sets out new interconnection criteria, but 
announces that a pipeline may not deny an interconnection on economic grounds.

I think it looks good.  a few suggestions though:

I haven't read the whole reprt so I can't say for sure that it alleges no 
price gouging (make sure to forward this to Jeff ... my e-mail is slow on the 
road).  We can say though, that instead of blaming generators and marketers 
the report blames the structure of the market for California's woes.

I think we should shorten the quote to something like "" the reprt is 
consistent with what we have said all along.

We should say that the scheduling penalties part of the order will ""penalize 
utilities for underscheduling"" not predicting.

Hedging is not about holding pirces down so much as it is about protecting 
people from wild price swings ... that's what allowing utilities to buy 
outside the spot should help do.

(Also, my title is just EVP and Chief of Staff)

Thanks for talking to me about this article for this Friday's eBiz.

Please read it over and let me have comments tomorrow morning (Thursday). it
goes live 5 p.m. Thursday evening.

Sorry for AOL -- my Notes is wreaking havoc today.

(Jeff -- Steve confirmed that the report said power sellers did not exercise
market power or price gouging, so I put it in the article.)

Take care,

To all,

Given today's e-mail traffic, I would like to invite everyone to attend next
month's EMCA meeting.  We will be talking about major projects that we may
want to undertake in the coming year.  I went to the PIP meeting last week
and we discussed the the process involved for setting up an official
citizen's patrol in our neighborhood.  If we, as a group, decide this is
necessary, then we can work with the Storefront to get rained and then the
police will provide us with all of the official signs to post on streets and
patrol cars.  They said  that crime normally shows a significant decrease in
neighborhoods that have taken on the responsibility of a patrol.  Also, my
husband, Bruce Hastings, has volunteered to be the PIP representative this
year, so he will be interested in tracking these trends.

I hope that everyone will try to come on the February 19th for the discussion
of what we want to put on our plate for next year.

See you there!
Cheryl Hastings

it's one of those theoretically great trades, but those don't always work.  
Still, I'll put it on and win 7 times out of 10.  just so hard for the market 
to rally the backwardation is so weak. can easily see h going under if no 
weather appears.

Fran,

List below are some questions that HPL personnel are asking:

What will happen if I tell AEP I do not want an offer?

We have heard from pretty reliable sources that AEP only wants 60 to 75 
employees.  Do we know anything about this??

Can I post, even though I have only been in my current job less than one year?

What happens to my balance in the current pension plan (cash part)?

What happens to my options left to vest?

Will my time at Enron bridge to AEP for vacation and retirement?

Will Enron review all of the offers to make sure they are equivalent?

Who will decide if it is an equivalent offer?

If it is not an equivalent offer, how long before 1) I am severed from Enron, 
2) how long will I
be in the redeployment pool? 3). What will the severence package look like?  
4) When will 
severence be paid?

Let me know.  I'll keep gathering the questions.

thanks

bob"

Please see the attached revision to the meeting notes.  You will see the 
change indicated in RED under Issue #2, Gas Daily.  We want to put this item 
on HOLD for now because there are more implications to this change that we 
need to resolve before coding begins.  The focus for now should be on putting 
physical positions in TDS--identifying all issues associated with it, resolve 
questions on where/how to get the position data, what should be filtered, 
design of the new screens, etc.  

Also, for your information--from now on we will be including Jeff Gossett and 
Russ Severson in our weekly meetings as I believe they can help tremendously 
with position reporting and how we currently get information from Sitara, 
CPR, ERMS & TAGG.  I will send you all an e-mail on Monday letting you know 
the time and place of next week's meeting.  Normally I want to hold the 
meetings on Wednesday afternoons; however--next week I may have to move it to 
Tuesday.  I will let you know first thing Monday morning.  Let me know if you 
have any questions or concerns.

Greetings,

I'm working with Sheila Tweed and others at ENA and EECC in developing a more 
standardized contract with GE for equipment purchases.  The goal is to 
develop a more efficient contracting process, and to avoid negotiating the 
same  points repeatedly, with varying results among business units.  Sheila 
has suggested that I drop you a line to see if this is something you might 
find interesting and/or helpful.

You now have my email address, and my phone number is 713 345 7566.  Please 
let me know your thoughts about participating in the process.

Thank you,

Kay"

Mark,

Turbine 5 (the prototype I think) shows up on some graphs but not on all 
graphs.  Do you know why this is occurring?

Great.  Glad to hear it.  Did you get my voice mail?  Makes sense for you to 
go ahead and start cobbling together a formal proposal.  I've talked to folks 
internally (and will discuss further with them tomorrow and Friday when I'm 
in Houston).  I'd like you to keep the information confidential, but I'm 
fairly confident that we're already at the point where it's not a matter of 
whether but of what the terms and conditions of the contract and the scope of 
the project will be.

Best,

Agree that Enron shouldn't be the lead.  An economist should be the lead with 
a broad group of folks funding.  Seems funny that EPSA wouldn't have an 
interest in the debate over how market power is assessed and addressed.

Sounds very good.  

Might be useful to get a ""reputable"" economist to write a paper that 1) 
describes traditional means for defining, identifying and mitigating market 
power, 2) compares those with the ""new"" means folks are coming up with these 
days,  and 3) comments on the ""split"" in the academic community over the 
issues.  

When Steve Kean and I discussed the notion initially, thought it might be a 
good idea to gently ""pile on"" to the public discussion with the goal of 
making clear 1) just how complex this issue is and 2) how important it will 
be to have a thorough analysis (say, about 12+ months worth?) before rushing 
to judgment on anything Joskow might allege in his paper.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

Having read the Hogan paper, I think that the ""academic"" community is 
somewhat divided on this issue.  If we want to move forward on the issues 
Joskow addresses, I would recommend that EPSA be the vehicle.  The entire 
marketer / generator community needs to counter.

What do people think about seeking activity through EPSA, WPTF, and/or IEP of 
CA  to push back on the studies and analysis especially after the Dec 13 
Order?  I don't think that the discussions will be ending very soon.

The Joskow/Kahn paper raises two issues:  price above cost  and witholding.  

Enron obviously has concerns with the ""price above cost"" analysis.  I drafted 
some specific concerns and put them into a draft to Enron's reponse to Hoeker 
Question 1.  Although the detail was dropped in the final draft, the basic 
technical concerns were laid out there. To really rebut Joskow/Kahn would 
take considerable work.  Jeff D's idea was to write a paper that raised 
issues and indicated how complicated a ""correct"" response would  be.

The Joskow/Kahn withholding section has recieved criticism from the ISO so I 
am not sure Enron needs to respond to that.

I think my bottom line now is that the debate at FERC will soon be over or 
enter a new stage on the 13th.  As far as how a response would help us in 
California, I think requires a discussion with Jeff.

Before we bring in Seabron Adamson to do some analysis, I'd like your read of 
the Joskow and Hogan papers.   When we have our understanding straight, let's 
talk.

FYI. In bizarre times, help can sometimes come from bizarre places.  Granted, 
we're likely to disagree strongly with Hogan's continued obsession with 
Poolco, but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be 
helpful---I've read the Joskow paper, but haven't yet had a chance to review 
the Hogan piece.  

Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the Joskow/Kahn 
""analysis""  (remember it's Ed Kahn, not Alfred Kahn).  Seems that it would be 
very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power 
included in the paper done by Hogan & Co.  If, in the end, there ain't 
nothing useful, so be it.  But seems like there's little downside to 
exploring it.

Jim, my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals 
folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper.  Might want to 
include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull 
Seabron Adamson into the thinking, too.  Ultimately, may be preferable to 
have any assessment of Joskow and/or Hogan to come from economists, rather 
than directly from us. 

Best,
Jeff

Has FERC Gone Far Enough in California?
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission isn't going far enough in its 
attempt to reform the California wholesale electric market, according to a 
paper by three prominent economists done for San Diego Gas and Electric. The 
paper by John D. Chandley, Scott M. Harvey, and William W. Hogan argues that 
FERC should first end the artificial separation that divides the California 
Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator, rather than 
worrying about the governance of the two institutions.
""The change in governance may help,"" says the paper - ""Electricity Market 
Reform in California"" - ""but it is not likely to be decisive in the near 
term. Explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and 
trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be 
accomplished within an acceptable time frame."" Hogan, of the Kennedy School 
of Government, has been writing since 1995 in opposition to California's 
market separation.
Also, argues the paper, freeing the California utilities to engage in forward 
contracting is no panacea. ""The expectation that merely allowing utilities to 
participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high 
prices is problematic and not supported by the commission's staff report,"" 
says the analysis, adding that ""putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts 
in the present environment may make things worse."" If the underlying problem 
in California is high cost and low capacity, requiring forward contracting 
could harm not only California but also the entire Western U.S. electric 
system.
FERC's $150 so-called ""soft cap"" is a wild card that has the three economists 
scratching their heads. ""It does not appear in the staff report and there is 
little critical analysis of their implications, other than the discussion of 
Commissioner [Curt] Hebert."" If the intent of the soft cap is to move toward 
cost justification for bids above $150/MWh, then FERC is headed into an 
administrative morass ""that would rival those under wellhead price controls 
in the natural gas industry.""
If, on the other hand, the soft cap is ""truly soft"" and would only require 
some paper work at FERC and the possibility of a refund if the price is 
eventually deemed not just and reasonable, ""there might be little impact on 
consumer prices (particularly if the principal sources of those high prices 
are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of 
market power). Even so, the proposal might serve to deter entry and new 
investments, thus combining the worst of both worlds, high consumer prices 
and little or no new investment.""
FERC's proposed order in California also demonstrates confusion about just 
what constitutes market power. The paper cites the proposed order's lawyerly, 
obfuscatory conclusion that ""while this record does not support findings of 
specific exercises of market power, and while we are not able to reach 
definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers, there is clear 
evidence that in California market structure and rules provide the 
opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can 
result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the [Federal Power Act]."" The 
economists note, ""In this regard, the debate is confused because we are 
dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face.""
In the case of California, say the economists, there is no evidence of market 
power. Even the practice of generators avoiding the day-ahead market in favor 
of the real-time market ""is a response to bad market design and pricing 
incentives (including price caps), but does not demonstrate the exercise of 
market power."" Nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of 
market power, they add. ""The distinction between direct marginal cost and 
opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion. Hence, a competitive 
bidder whose direct cost of generation is $40 but who could sell the same 
energy outside California for $100 should bid no less than $100. This would 
not be an exercise of market power.""

Hello Mike,

My name is Brian Dawson and I work in ENA Merchant Finance.   I heard you 
speak at the Adams Mark Hotel last week discussing the future of EGM.  I 
wanted to let you know that I may have some information that might be useful 
to you.  I have a close friend who is the Vice President Marketing/Purchasing 
of Rigid Building Systems located off of Aldine Westfield and Beltway 8.  He 
has over 20 years in the industry of buying from the mills and selling steel 
components to contractors, end users, and service centers.  We were 
discussing the steel industry as a whole and some of his ideals were 
identical to yours.  I didn't know if you would be the right person for this 
information.  If you would like for me to forward this information to someone 
else, please let me know.  Thank you for your consideration.

Good - bad?

508957 - changed offset from -1.5 to -1 on 2/6 per Stephanie Piwetz (verbal 
Mirant checkout)

All the rest of the deals I entered for Mike Swerzbin yesterday in my deal 
blotter, which defaults to Short Term California. I noticed immediately after 
saving the deals that they were under the wrong desk, and changed them to 
Long Term Northwest in deal entry. Are there other problems with the deals? 
The only change should be the desk. Please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

It looks like you made quite a few changes to some deals and I don't see 
anything in the comment section.  Can you just take a quick look and see if 
you know what you changed on any of these.  If not, I can look it up in the 
audit viewer, but it makes things go a lot quicker if we don't have to go 
into the audit viewer for each deal.

Thanks!

Utility Holding Company Act) and FTC to raise our issues with regard to 
E.On's anticompetitive activities in Germany.  As I mentioned earlier, 
Enron's ability to use US federal and state regulatory proceedings to 
leverage change in Germany is limited and could backfire on Enron.

For example, the standard used by the FERC to approve acquisitions of public 
utilities subject to its jurisdiction is limited in scope and does not allow 
us to intervene as an interested party simply because we have problems in 
Germany.  

I think the best course of action is to highlight this as a general Germany - 
US trade issue and get both the USG and the Congress interested.  There may 
also be some scope for raising this as a political issue in states where E.On 
is proposing an acquisition (let's hope they try to buy a Texas utility).

I have been trading calls with the German expert at USTR and I also have 
ameeting tomorrow with the Dept. of Commerce where I will have an opportunity 
to raise this issue. When you are here in august I can schedule other 
meetings.

I'll call again tomorrow so we can prepare some background information that 
will highlight our issues."

Subject: spoke too soon


Unfortunately i am too late to halt my last email. Perspective comes quickly
at 8000 meters and today, thinking back on the ascent and all the rock
climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my
perpetually clumsy condition (wrsened by AMS), I am happy to be alive. The
weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead and
dying, including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late for
the north side. By the time i am allowed to send this, the media will have
already begun reporting on this tragedy. I was slowed by my vomiting and had
i continued, i likely would have been trudging up with this group.

In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends: ensuring
his safety so suz and i could take a vacation. He is stuck on the ridge now,
dying, and will likely be dead by morning. One of our strongest guides is
with him and he, too, will probably die. This guy is super strong but the
altitude has snatched him. We're in shock here and can do nothing but stare
into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight. I have been
assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives. A
member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp 2 this morning, 3
Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge, and a spaniard is flirting
with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema, despite Chris
Warner's valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night. When i
think of this mountain now, i think only of death.

Russ is quite experienced in hig-altitude rescues but this is the first time
he has unleashed the team for our own. It is a totaly professional
logistical operation (locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up
into the jet stream), relying heavily on the sherps who are just incredibly
strong. Many stories of heroism over last 24 hours and many to come. The
guide and the client spent the night on the ridge (8650 meters), incoherent
and immobile, freezing, but they were saved when Asmus turned around from a
desperate stumble home, climbed the second step (brutal) for the second time
in 10 hours, and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark.
Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes, reaching
top camp (8300 meters...still incredibly dangerous) at 11:30 pm. It was a
relatively warm night (just below)and both client and guide were seen moving
space blankets this morning through the telescope. Alive. But they could not
stand. One could not see. No comms. Bivouacs above 8000 meters are epics and
you are sure to read about this.

Coordinating therescue from the Col, Russ then rousted all available bodies
and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days, Purba and
Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone, humping oxygen. The
American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up
their summit attempt (remember, they failed last week and also failed in '99
so this is a huge sacrifice) to make the rescue. It looked bleak this
morning but after some injections our teammates began to move, carried by
the strong Americans. As i type, they have been moving at a snail's pace and
the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselves.We hope our
sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be an
absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue. Remember, that ridge is 14
inches across for stretches, dropping 10,000 feet on either side. When i
gazed down 2 nights ago, it was truly like staring out of the window of a
plane, so steep was the drop. The sherps are going to have to be supermen.

From the ridge and high camp, chris and asmus (they've been wasting there
for over 36 hours now) have been gathering oxygen for the 2000 meter descent
to ABC. They are sucking some themselves to ensure we don't have a
double-rescue. I'm feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help
with the rescue, assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive. Too high
for a helo on this side so we'll have to platoon them down asap. Other
members who summitted earlier are still up too high, too slow descending
from 'safe' camps, and i may help them down as well. So i will not be back
by mem day--we have to get these people down.

The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope, sulking
and making occasional trips to the waste moraine. The client was slower and
slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field. I thought: uh oh.
Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold
and the guide was pursuaded by the client. Soon russ was on the radio
screaming at the guide to drag the client down, but the hour grew late and
suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap, both men immobile
and nearly incoherent, the guide kicking and draggin the client, to no
avail. Asmus was with them and performed valiantly, as i mentioned, but no
one was in a position to help. At that height, every second counts and the
other teams rushed past on their way to safety. When you rush into a burning
building you can't linger, especially if your physical performance is
literally cut in half.

I am praying for these two--and the russians--and  it's hard to think f
anything else as they progress home, mumbling, step by step. I have messages
from their wives but they are unable to [process spoken language at this
point. Even if they get down, i wonder what the results will be. It's really
sad. I am sure they are also severely dehydrated--i'll explain the process
when i get home but siffice to say you literally can't boil water fast
enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude. My heartbeat at top camp
was 180 when i was 'resting' in my sleeping bag before the attempt. My
tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids
coming at a rate of a liter an hour, doing nothing.

I feel lucky today. Very lucky. When i think of my own descent, alone,
throwing up along the way yesterday, i realize just how razor-thin this
whole thing is. There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my
jumar on a supposedly new rope, ony to reach the anchor point to find a
ten-year-old knot, totally fried by the uv rays. Other times i stepped in
snow footprints and slipped, sliding down on my stomach until the rope
jerked taut. Too many ways to die here.The aussie who gave me his water in
the bowl may have prevented another casualty. Who's to say? Problem here is
that, unlike the events we're used to when we sprint to the finish line (we
used to say in crew that the perfect race was when you passsed out at the
finish), you have to reserve a certain amount to get the hell down the
mountain. And it's so hard to do that. Is a quarter tank enough? Half? Or do
you need even more because, in truth, you are dying from the moment you
leave camp 3 (not even top camp).

I will pass this info only when the word is out--sorry--but will keep you
updated from there once i talk ro russ. It's hard watching friends die but
we're helpless down here."

Hey Gillette,

The heat rate is going to depend on the type of fuel and the construction date of the unit.  Unfortunately, most of that info is proprietary.  

Chris Gaskill is the head of our fundamentals group and he might be able to supply you with some of the guidelines.

Hey Bass,

I have a question and I am hoping you can help me.  I am wanting to compile a list of all the different types of power plants and their respective heat rates to determine some sort of generation ratio.

i.e.	Coal		4 mmbtu = 1 MW
	Simple Cycle	11 mmbtu = 1 MW

Please let me know if you can help me or point me to someone who can.  Just FYI...Bryan suggested that I call you so blame him as you curse me under your breath right now.

Thanks,
Lisa

Sara, below is the ""floating price"" definition we discussed.  FYI, I talked 
to Joe on two other issues: (1) He agreed that longer-term it would be 
desirable to come up with a form-generating technology such that a definition 
of ""Delivery Date"" is inserted only when relevant (i.e., triggered by the 
particular reference price mentioned), so we will keep that in mind, and (2) 
He is aware of the errors in the ""Cash Settlement Amount"" definition 
(""Multiplied"" is capitalized; ""price"" in ""Strike Price Differential"" is not; 
a couple of spaces don't belong, etc.).  I didn't completely understand his 
explanation, but it was something to the effect that this had snuck in from 
an ERMS  form and he is already talking to the right person about getting it 
fixed.

I just spoke with Mark and he indicated that AEC is sending the agreement 
back to Gerald with a couple of amendments.  Gerald or I will correct the 
header and add the deal date prior to resending the amended final agreement 
back to AEC.

Tyrell, this confirm is still incorrect on Page 2 according to the file you 
sent me... at the top of Page 2, when you print it out it is still showing... 
JM Huber. . I told Mark this, It was supposed to be fixed.  

You need to get it fixed, put in the deal date and get a new copy out to 
AEC... It is unacceptable that we sent this out again... in error !!!

FYI - 
wanted to let you guys know about a few things:
1.  There is a central desk vacation calendar on my desk by the sun machine - 
it is a little black date book.  Please put any future requests in there so 
that we can keep track of who needs off when.  I would like to try and keep 
from having more than 3 people out at a time.
2.  Physical gas daily options - when booking these, please be very careful.  
These need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly 
swaps.  This will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader 
at gas daily as opposed to mid.  This is very important to avoid OA variances.
3.  When booking deals in sitara, please look at your swaps when they are 
created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price.  This is 
important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and I 
notice last night on a gd option, that the swap did not come at the correct 
gd curve.
4.  I am going to set up a mtg. for friday or monday to discuss OA, the 
process and how to prepare forms.
5.  Please take advantage of time that you can spend with your traders.  All 
the traders have expressed their approval for each of their book admins to 
spend a morning watching them trade to better understand why they take the 
positions that they do.  The only request I have had is that we sit there 
quietly and observe and ask questions after trading.  Please utilize this 
opportunity to build a relationship with your traders - this is good for 
career development.
6. I will try and set up individual meetings with each of you to go over your 
training plans.

Please shout with any questions.

Dear Dr. Kaminsky,
?
I was in SIAM Workshop last Friday and I enjoyed  your talk very much.? I 
wonder whether you will be able to email the  material you have presented and 
also give me some references to start  with.
My Background is B.S. M.A. in Math, Ph.D. in Fluid Mechanics,  2 yrs Post Doc 
doing Computational fluid dynamics in parallel machines (IBM  SP).? For the 
past 4 yrs I am doing the Basin Simulation development with  Mobil.? I always 
wonder how? the financial problems can be solved and  how the numerical 
computing, especially, supercomputers, can be applied to these  problems. 
Your talk is a very good starting place for me.
?
Thank you very much.
?
Best Regards,
?

Gerald,

Take a look at this and let's discuss.  They are ready to sign this copy if 
we are ok with it.

Below is a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint 
against El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point.

The meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts 
to Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs  
of $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and 
the gathering fuel was increased.  Accordingly, producers are seeking a 
minimum of $17  million in compensation in some form or  another.

The biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the 
Socal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu/day.   Socal Gas stated that 
this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to 
as Gatekeeper)..  The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could 
be implemented as early as October 1, 2001.  When the Gatekeeper is 
implemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock 
border and must match up with the intra-state transport.  

SoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock 
delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the 
capapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock.  They 
also stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum 
of 300 to meet core needs.  However, they wanted some type of compensation if 
their volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo 
until the Gatekeeper was implemented.  This would result in firm rights being 
established at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.

Williams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a 
reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.

After much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:

Recommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.  Does not 
relate to receipt point rights.

1)  Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000);

2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000)

3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or 
Ehrenberg.  It is recommended that they
 give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up 
like amount at Topock as well as shift an additional  70000 mmbtu/day from 
Topock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 115000 being shifted  to Ehrenberg.

4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows:

   Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave Topock
Texaco   40    135
Burlington  26    74
Aero   5    15
Borax   7    12
LADWP  0    36
SWGas   0    20

5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows:

Expansion Shippers  78000 
Socal Gas           425000
BLK 3                               348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;99-Williams;189 
El Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams)
Total 851000
540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput.

The producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and 
felt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off 
the top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3.

Separate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El 
Paso's counter -proposal.  

Producer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent 
thruput increased.  Will accept CD reduction, rate design change or other 
forms of compensation.   For  the recommended volumes moved to Mohave/Pge 
Topock, they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as 
converting that path to a 100 volumetric rate.  In other words, if the 
producers used the delivery point, they would pay max rate.  If they did not, 
they would not pay anything.

Block 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their 
deals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 70 percent.  For 
volumes shifted to non-Socal Points , they also want a 100 percent volumetric 
rate.

Bottom-line is  how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this 
case.  Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will 
study  its entirety.  No follow-up meeting was scheduled.

Another topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived 
gaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more 
gas than they need in anticipation of cuts.  It is thought that if this could 
be controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows.  
El Paso recommended the following :  Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan 
based on previous day's  total nom from all basins.   No limits on Cycle 
2-4.  This caused some concerns because of week-end load swings 
andfluctuatingpower-plant loads.  However, eoc's were willing to establish a 
technical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets 
resolved.

Regarding pooling, El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the 
keystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the 
bondad.  This process is in its early stages of conflict.  Most people (Duke, 
Southern, Williams, Coral)  are not on board with this.  I will keep you 
advised of development.  Please advise if you have any questions.

Subject:	Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff"

Press Release

Electric Power Supply Association Tells FERC That New California ISO Board 
and Its Flawed Market Plan Must Go

WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 19, 2001--The Electric Power Supply 
Association (EPSA) told federal regulators today that a lack of political and 
market independence in the governance of the California Independent System 
Operator (CAISO) is the first of several fatal flaws in the grid operator's 
proposed market stabilization plan.

``EPSA believes that the time has come for the commission to enforce its Dec. 
15 order mandating a truly independent CAISO,'' the association said in a 
filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). ``The first step 
in such enforcement is to replace the incumbent CAISO board with an 
independent board.''

According to the comments, the CAISO continues to be transformed from an 
``independent operator'' of interstate transmission resources to a partisan 
advocate for the state, now the dominant marketplace buyer through its 
Department of Water Resources (DWR).

``Because of the conflicts inherent in the politicization of the CAISO, there 
exists a more urgent need for the commission to remedy the situation than was 
the case in November 2000,'' said EPSA, citing the lack of an independent ISO 
board as the source of a series of other fatal flaws in the market plan.

``Rather than presenting a well thought out, comprehensive 
market-stabilization plan, developed with meaningful stakeholder input, the 
CAISO has proposed a half-baked radical restructuring of the California 
market, recycling calls for counterproductive price controls and suggesting 
the implementation of bits and pieces of eastern ISO markets.''

Because of the regional nature of the wholesale power markets in the West, 
the association also said it is vitally important that FERC ensure that all 
market participants are treated fairly and comparably.

``The consequences of the political power being exercised over the CAISO are 
palpable. The CAISO has taken positions before the commission, unrelated to 
the reliability of the transmission system, which were unashamedly intended 
to favor the interests of the State of California and DWR over other market 
participants in negotiations for the sale of energy.''

``While it may be politically expedient to blame high prices on 'market 
power,' market stabilization and repair must focus on the critical issues of 
poorly designed markets, inadequate generation resources and deficient 
infrastructure,'' according to EPSA's filing. ``A continued witch hunt for 
evidence of market power, together with continuing credit problems, now pose 
the greatest obstacle to the promise and potential of robust competitive 
markets and the enhanced reliability they will provide.''

``Equally important, establishment of an independent CAISO is vital to the 
long-term resolution of California's energy problems and the stability of the 
entire western region,'' EPSA said.

EPSA is the national trade association representing competitive power 
suppliers, including independent power producers, merchant generators and 
power marketers. EPSA members provide reliable, competitively priced 
electricity from environmentally responsible facilities in U.S. and global 
power markets. EPSA seeks to bring the benefits of competition to all power 
customers.
N
ote to Editors: A complete copy of EPSA's filing will soon be available on 
the EPSA Web site at www.epsa.org, or by contacting Simone Byrd at 
202/628-8200, sbyrd@epsa.org.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 Although McNair is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury report for 
Sunday's game in Philadelphia, he is expected to get the start. His thumb is 
still sore and he's been icing it regularly, but it's not expected to keep 
him from playing. Still, the Eagles have a solid defense and the Titans' 
passing game has struggled of late, so you might want to consider starting 
someone else this week.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 George did not practice yesterday in order to rest his injured right big 
toe, although he and Coach Jeff Fisher said he could have participated. 
Fisher wants George to be able to fully participate in today's session, and 
expects he will be able to. Considering George has held up this well through 
a variety of injuries in recent weeks, there's little reason to expect he 
won't start Sunday in his return to Philadelphia and post solid Fantasy 
numbers.  

 Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Ward is listed as probable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game 
against Oakland. With Pittsburgh's receivers hurting, expect him to play and 
be the focus of the passing game. He's still marginal as a Fantasy producer, 
though.  

 Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 The Steelers will be without Burress likely for the remainder of the season 
after learning he has a torn ligament and two broken bones in his right 
wrist. He said he originally sustained the injury during the season opener, 
but played the next 11 games despite constant pain in the wrist. Burress had 
it X-rayed and placed in a cast after practice yesterday, and it will require 
surgery. With him out, Courtney Hawkins will continue to start in his place 
for the next four games.  

 Jamel White , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Browns have listed White as questionable with a shoulder injury for 
Sunday's game against Jacksonville. He has performed fairly well spelling 
fellow rookie Travis Prentice in recent weeks, and may earn himself 
consideration in the Browns' RB plans for 2001. He won't provide you with 
much this season, though.  

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/30/00 
 The Jaguars will be without linebackers Hardy Nickerson, who has a knee 
injury, and Erik Storz, who has a broken thumb, as well as safety Erik Olson, 
who has an ankle injury, for Sunday's game against the Browns. Fortunately, 
linebackers Lonnie Marts, listed as probable after missing four games with a 
groin injury, and Kevin Hardy, probable with an ankle injury, are both 
expected to play. Despite all the injuries, keep in mind that this might be 
the best week to start the Jacksonville defense, as it faces a Cleveland 
offense that has been decimated by injuries.   

 Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 ""The Green Lantern"" had his light burned out last week against the Bears, 
catching only one pass for eight yards in the entire game. After four solid 
weeks, Chrebet has caught only four passes for 41 yards over his last two 
games. He faces off against a Colts' secondary that he burned for eight 
catches and 140 yards receiving in Week Ten, so a productive day is certainly 
not out of the question. Although he hasn't been overly consistent, Chrebet 
will likely find his way onto many starting lineups as the playoffs begin.    

 Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Shea is listed as questionable with a thigh muscle injury for Sunday's game 
in Jacksonville. If he can't play, either Mark Campbell, who served as the 
starter last Sunday, or O.J. Santiago would be the tight end. Even if he's 
healthy, Shea isn't going to carry your Fantasy team through the playoffs.  

 Richie Anderson , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Anderson continued to be the Jets' secret weapon last week, catching six 
passes for 69 yards and a score against the Bears. Although Anderson's 
numbers have been commendable between the lines, his value in the world of 
Fantasy isn't as solid. Unless you are involved in a deeper league, avoid 
playing Anderson during your Fantasy playoffs.      

 O.J. Santiago , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Santiago is listed as questionable with a knee injury for the Browns' game 
in Jacksonville on Sunday. If he can't go, Mark Campbell would be the backup 
tight end, and if Aaron Shea is also out, then Marc Edwards would serve as 
Campbell's backup for the second straight game. We don't recommend any of the 
Browns' tight ends.  

 Bernie Parmalee , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Parmalee has been surprisingly productive over the past two weeks while 
splitting time with Curtis Martin, who has been less than 100 percent after 
injuring his gluteus maximus. Parmalee caught six passes and accounted for 74 
yards of total offense in last week's win over Chicago.  Starting Parmalee in 
the playoffs, however, is extremely risky, so stick with Martin or look to 
another option if possible.    

 Doug Pederson , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Browns Coach Chris Palmer hasn't made a final decision on who will start at 
quarterback Sunday against Jacksonville, although if Pederson's bruised ribs 
don't heal in time, it would make the decision an easy one. Pederson was held 
out of throwing drills yesterday and will probably be limited the rest of the 
week, and looks to be a gametime decision. Palmer may opt to use rookie 
Spergon Wynn this week either way. Considering the Browns' struggles in the 
passing game added to this quarterback controversy, Pederson isn't going to 
help Fantasy owners during the playoffs.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 According to The Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals are planning on 
evaluating Mitchell over the next few games in hopes that he will re-sign to 
compete with Akili Smith for the starting QB job next season. Team president 
Mike Brown made the statements after watching Mitchell participate in his 
first practice in 10 days yesterday. Mitchell is expected to start Sunday 
against Arizona after missing last Sunday's game with a sprained knee 
ligament. Despite a weak Cardinals' defense, we don't recommend him for your 
league's playoff run.   

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Mean Machine Updated 11/30/00 
 Sanders is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Bengals 
with a quadricep injury.  The injury certainly hasn't helped his numbers - he 
has caught only five passes for 63 yards in his last two games.  Avoid 
starting Sanders if at all possible, especially during the playoffs.  He is 
far too inconsistent to play at such a crucial stage of your Fantasy 
season.     

 David Boston , WR ARI - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 Boston caught only one pass for 32 yards in last week's loss to the Giants.  
He has been hampered by a nagging hamstring injury of late, which hasn't help 
his numbers in recent weeks.  He has had only one game with more than 90 
yards receiving in the last six weeks, and has scored only once in that same 
span. If the Cards' enemic offense is ever going to score, however, it could 
be against the Bengals. Unless you have more solid receivers on your roster, 
starting Boston simply on this week's matchup isn't a bad move.     

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Hearst is listed as questionable on the injury report but won't be of any 
help to a Fantasy team this season.  He was recently activated from the 
injury list after missing most 1999 and 2000 with an ankle injury.    

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/30/00 
 Moore has been downgraded to questionable on the injury report.  He suffered 
a shoulder stinger in Sunday's game against St. Louis.  If he is unable to 
play Chad Morton and Terry Allen will handle the carries.  The Saints have 
been able to run on every team they have played this season no matter who 
their RB is.  But if you are going to use a New Orleans back go with Morton 
who is the healthiest and most explosive of the bunch.    

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 Jones could see some increased playing time now that the season is coming to 
a close, but he will still have little impact for Fantasy owners at this 
point in the season. Jones' rookie campaign has been a real disappointment, 
and he should have been a casuality for owners much earlier in the year.  

 Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Ramiro Updated 11/30/00 
 Pittman had a huge game against the Giants last week, catching ten passes 
while compiling 193 yards of total offense. He also scored the Cardinals' 
only touchdown of the game on a 36-yard pass from Dave Brown. Pittman will 
face a Cincinnati defense this week that ranks 24th in the league against the 
run, so he could be in line for another strong performance. The only thing 
that Fantasy owners who have Pittman on their roster should worry about is if 
Arizona decides to give rookie Thomas Jones more playing time now that the 
season is winding down.   

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Rams are expected to decide on Thursday whether or not Wilkins is 
healthy enough to play.  He will undergo an extensive kicking routine and 
will be evaluated from thereafter.  Wilkins has missed the past few games 
because of a quadriceps injury.  

 Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Mean Machine Updated 11/30/00 
 Hayes practiced Wednesday and will likely play in Sunday's game against the 
Rams.  He missed Monday's game against the Rams due to a groin injury.  Hayes 
hasn't been a star by no means this season but he has been helpful to Fantasy 
teams.    

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - The Rounders Updated 11/30/00 
 It looks like rookie Brad Hoover will start at RB again this Sunday for the 
Panthers.  Biakabutuka has been sidelined for the past few weeks by turf 
toe.  He was initally listed as probable for Sunday's home game against the 
Rams but left practice early Wednesday after experiencing pain in his toe.  
""I'd say right now his status is probably a little more questionable than I 
thought it would be,"" head coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer . 
 It would be wise to keep Biakabutuka out of your lineup.  Although Hoover 
had a good game this week it might even be safer to use a more proven back on 
your Fantasy team.    

 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 Wheatley practiced on Wednesday and is listed as probable for this week's 
game against the Steelers. Head Coach Jon Gruden said that Wheatley moved 
around well during the workout, so expect the Raiders' back to be ready to 
play. Wheatley has proven that he has a high tolerance for pain, so even if 
he isn't 100 percent for the Pittsburgh game, Fantasy owners can rest assured 
that he will play.     

 Herbert Goodman , RB GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Packers have activated Goodman from their practice squad.  He had played 
in five games this season before being placed on the practice team on 
November 1.  He is used primarily on special teams and will be of little use 
to a Fantasy team at this point in the year.   

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 After missing most of the season because of a broken leg, Bradford is now 
recovering from torn cartilage in his right knee.  He still hopes to return 
for a December 10 game against the Lions.  Right now he is having trouble 
pushing off on his knee.  Stay away from Bradford in your Fantasy league 
until next season.     

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/30/00 
 Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England.  Although he is still listed as 
questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is 
optimistic. ""Right now, I'd say he'll play,"" said Cunningham, ""but we'll see 
what (today) brings."" Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it 
would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - 
especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning.    

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Smith's injured right hamstring has made significant progress since he 
missed last week's game against the Colts, and the Dolphins are cautiously 
optimistic that he  could return for this week's game against Buffalo. 
Despite experiencing a slight ""tweak"" in the hamstring after Wednesday's 
practice, Smith still believes he will be ready to go. ""I feel fine,"" Smith 
said, ""I have no pain in my leg. I'm running and cutting without any pain.""  
Those Fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation, however,  would be 
wise to steer clear of Smith this week. Playing in the cold at Buffalo could 
hinder Smith's performance, which is a chance you won't want to take at this 
point of the season.     

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Contrary to earlier reports, the Dolphins are now ""optimistic"" that Fiedler 
will be their starting quarterback for this week's game against Buffalo. He 
took 75 percent of the snaps with the first team during Wednesday's practice 
and reported that he felt fine. It would be a remarkable recovery for 
Fielder, who couldn't even raise his right arm on Sunday. ""If he's OK 
(today), he's starting,"" said Head Coach Dave Wannstedt. Even if he does 
start, Fielder isn't a very strong option for Fantasy owners who have 
advanced to their league's playoffs.     

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Enis has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season.  Where have we heard 
this before? During the offseason Enis bulked up to 250 pounds and promised 
to run over the opposition.  He looked slow carrying the ball this season and 
was replaced at HB by James Allen.  With HB Marlon Barnes and Allen in tow, 
Enis may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere.  He is down to 242 
pounds already and would like to reach 235.  Even if he does reach this goal 
don't count on him being too productive.  Wait and see if he re-emerges as a 
star before you gamble and put him on your Fantasy team next year.     

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 McNown is listed as questionable but will be the emergency QB for sunday's 
game against the Bears, behind Shane Matthews and backup Mark Hartsell.  It 
appears that McNown is done for the Fantasy season.  His seperated shoulder 
rendered him helpless for the latter part of 2000,  but even when he was 
healthy he didn't produce too much.    

More Updates 

 Player News?Teams? 
 Meximullets Player News 

 Charlie Garner , Active RB Updated 11/13/00 
Garner emerged from a two-week slump by gaining 102 yards on 25 carries and 
scoring a touchdown. Look for Garner to have a big game next week against a 
thin Atlanta Falcons defense. 

 Antonio Freeman , Active WR Updated 11/22/00 
Freeman had a relatively quiet game Sunday against the Colts catching only 
three passes for 37 yards. He did manage to haul in a 17-yard TD pass from 
Brett Favre. No. 2 receiver Bill Schroeder won't have the game that he had 
last week, which will allow the mediocre Panthers' secondary to focus on 
stopping Freeman. His numbers will improve this week but only slightly. 

 Skip Hicks , Reserve RB Updated 10/17/00 
Hicks saw limited action in Sunday's game against the Ravens. He rushed three 
times for seven yards and caught one pass for five yards. Unless Stephen 
Davis goes down, Hicks won't see much action. 

 Amani Toomer , Active WR Updated 11/29/00 
Toomer accounted for 89 yards of total offense and a touchdown in last Sunday 
night's 31-7 win over Arizona. He will face off against a talented Redskins' 
secondary this week that held him to only three catches and 31 yards in the 
team's first meeting. If your other wideouts have more favorable matchups 
this week, it might be wise to bench Toomer. 

 Justin Watson , Reserve RB Updated 11/13/00 
Watson fared better in his second start for Marshall Faulk Sunday. He gained 
62 yards on 17 carries. 

 Shawn Bryson , Reserve RB Updated 11/17/00 
With the injury to Sammy Morris, it looks as though Bryson will get the start 
this week against the Chiefs. If Morris has been one of your main tailbacks 
this season, it may be a good idea to pick up Bryson if he is still 
available. 

 Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 11/27/00 
Torry Holt caught six passes for 89 yards against the Saints Sunday. Look for 
Holt to put up similar numbers against the Panthers Sunday. 

 Donovan McNabb , Reserve QB Updated 11/27/00 
McNabb was McNasty against Washington, accounting for 262 yards of total 
offense and two touchdowns in the Eagles' 23-20 win at FedEx Field. He put 
the offensive unit on his shoulders and single-handedly kept Philadelphia in 
first place in the NFC East. Up next, McNabb will face a tough Tennessee 
squad who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the Jaguars. Don't expect 
huge numbers from McNabb this week, but do expect him to be the focal point 
of Philadelphia's offense once again. 

 Kyle Brady , Active TE Updated 10/30/00 
Brady finally found the end zone, scoring a touchdown in what was a career 
game for him against Dallas Sunday. Just one week after an eight-catch, 
111-yard performance against Washington, Brady broke loose for 10 catches for 
138 yards. Keep in mind that he's been getting opportunities lately due to 
the injury to Jimmy Smith, so his numbers shouldn't remain so extraordinary, 
but Mark Brunell will likely look to his tight end more often in the future. 

 Gary Anderson , Active K Updated 11/29/00 
Anderson continued his accuracy this season by making both of his attempts on 
Thanksgiving Day. He has made 20-of-21 attempts this season and is quietly 
having a year similar to the one he had in 1998 when he was perfect in the 
regular season. However, he is old and doesn't kick the long ones like he 
used to. Anderson won't go beyond 50 yards anymore but is pinpoint from 30-49 
yards. Look for him to add a few more field goals against the Lions this 
week. 

 Stephen Davis , Active RB Updated 11/28/00 
Head Coach Norv Turner has indicated that Davis should be ready to play in 
this week's pivotal NFC East matchup against the Giants. Davis missed last 
week's game against the Eagles with a hairline fracture of his right forearm. 
The return of Davis is great news for Fantasy players who own his rights, 
especially with the playoffs just around the corner. 

 Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 11/29/00 
Head coach Steve Mariucci is considering giving Garcia's backups Rick Mirer 
and Tim Rattay some playing time at the end of games to evaluate their 
standing with the team. This won't hurt Garcia's production too much but 
could cost him a few cheap TDs at the end of games. ""We've talked about it,"" 
Mariucci told the Contra Costa Times . ""I wouldn't mind Rick Mirer playing a 
little bit, either. ... If a situation presented itself when you could put 
your third guy (Rattay) in there without hurting the football team, I guess 
we would consider that."" 

 Bill Schroeder , Reserve WR Updated 11/20/00 
The Packers' wideout had what might have been his best game of the season 
against the Colts Sunday, racking up 155 yards on eight catches. He won't 
continue to post numbers like this, but look for Schroeder to have some 
success against the Panthers this Sunday. 

 Darnell Autry , Reserve RB Updated 11/27/00 
On nine carries, Autry gained just 25 yards. If you start him at anytime 
during the Fantasy playoffs, you may be risking your season. 

 Marcus Robinson , Reserve WR Updated 11/29/00 
Not having QB Cade McNown throw to him has really hurt Robinson's numbers. 
While playing with McNown in his first six games this season, Robinson had 32 
receptions for 506 yards (15.8 average) and four touchdowns. In his last five 
contests, Robinson has just 23 catches for 232 yards (10.1 yards), with one 
touchdown. Except for one quarter against the Eagles, Jim Miller and Shane 
Matthews were the quarterbacks in those ballgames. McNown is still another 
week or so away from playing so look for Robinson to continue to struggle. 

 Ravens , Reserve DT Updated 11/27/00 
Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming 
the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted 
yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its 
record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just 
seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, 
an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to 
say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore 
has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense 
during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and 
Arizona coming off the bye. 

 Redskins , Active DT Updated 11/17/00 
The 'Skins expect to have both cornerback Darrell Green and outside 
linebacker Shawn Barber back for Washington's Monday night tilt with the 
Rams. Green has missed three games with a strained calf muscle, while Barber 
has missed two games with a sprained MCL in his right knee. Washington will 
need a big performance from their defense on Monday night if they are to have 
any chance at beating the champs in the dome.

I agree that George is well suited to origination, but he has also spent 
quite a bit of time looking at investment opportunities for Koch in a wide 
variety of industries that they are active in. If EGM is looking at several 
acquisitions, I could see him being the point person for EGM on transactions 
and thus able to relieve some of the burden on the folks focusing on trading. 
However, I know that George is happy at Koch, so it would have to take a very 
exciting opportunity for him to leave, i.e., something where he would feel 
the job was ""tailor made"" for his skill set. Maybe we don't have something 
like that for him right now.

Subject: Resumes from George Damiris and Randy Balhorn

 Mike:

 I finally got George Damiris' resume (attached) as well as that of Randy 
Balhorn (also attached). I think when you read Randy's CV, you will be very 
impressed. I would go so far as to say that he was the smartest person I knew 
at Koch, and when you see the list of accomplishments that he had there, as 
well as what he was doing with Dreyfuss and Electricite de France, you will 
agree with me that he would be a terrific addition to Enron Global Markets. 
The even better news regarding Randy is that he recently left Dreyfuss due to 
issues with the EDF JV, so he is available immediately and he is very 
interested. He currently lives in London and I think that he knows Joe Gold. 
Please let me know if you would like me to do anything to help facilitate 
this further.  I think George is interested if there was a specific 
opportunity for him here that he felt was an even better fit than what he is 
doing with Koch. The fact that he is moving to Houston makes it pretty easy 
for us to keep having discussions with him. I would say, however, if I had to 
choose which among the two of them would have the most immediate impact if 
hired by Enron, it would have to be Randy, given his experience.

Thanks,

Basil

 I have worked for Enron for 8 1/2 years.  For what it is worth, I really 
enjoyed the recent ""Ode to Why"" commercial.  The imagery of past struggles 
shown with short video-clips was first class.  When I saw the ad on TV, it 
caught my attention and I knew I liked it even before I realized it was an 
Enron commercial.  Congratulations on what I believe is the best 
advertisement I have seen yet for Enron.  

  I read a brief article this morning that you may find of interest.  The 
name ""Enron"" will appear in Microsoft's spell-check dictionary in its Word 
2000 release.  Enron is certainly becoming a household name!

Subject: My model for spikes




Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis
the first of the preprints that I recently authored on my model for spikes in
power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power. In this
regard, I have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the
Center for Energy Finance Education and Research and the Institute for
Computational Finance at the UT Austin. Right now I am also in the process of
forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be
interested in receiving this preprint. Please let me know if you might be
interested in receiving this preprint.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,

Valery Kholodnyi
Manager of Quantitative Analysis
Research and Analytics Group
TXU Energy Trading

PS. Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for
spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power:

1. Valery A. Kholodnyi, The Stochastic Process for Power Prices with Spikes 
and
Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power, Preprint, TXU-RAG-01/00, 
July
2000.
2. Valery A. Khlolodnyi, Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-05/00, August, 2000.
3. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with 
Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-21/00, November 2000.
4. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at 
Two
Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices, Preprint
TXU-RAG-24/00, November 2000.
5. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with 
Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-25/00, November 2000.

As I have indicated to you in my previous e-mail, contrary to the standard
approaches, I model spikes directly, as self-reversing jumps on top of a
stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of
spikes. In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non-Markovian
process, even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is
Markovian. Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit
valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes, provided that
the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the
absence of spikes.

Paul Harvey Writes:

We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them
worse.

For my grandchildren, I'd like better.  I'd really like for them to
know about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cream and leftover meat
loaf sandwiches.  I really would.

I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn
honesty by being cheated.

I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the
car.
And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are
sixteen.

It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your
old dog put to sleep. I hope you get a black eye fighting for something
you believe in, I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger
brother. And it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle
of the room, but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you
because he's scared, I hope you let him.

When you want to see a movie and your little brother wants to tag
along, I hope you'll let him. I hope you have to walk uphill to school with
your friends and that you live in a town where you can do it safely. On
rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I hope you don't ask your
driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be seen riding with
someone as uncool as your Mom.

If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one
instead of buying one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read
books. When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add
and subtract in  your head.

I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on
a girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory
soap tastes like.

May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove
and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.  I don't care if you try a
beer once, but I hope you don't like it.  And if a friend offers you
dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend.

I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go
fishing with your Uncle.  May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy
during the holidays.  I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a
baseball through your neighbor's window and that she hugs you and
kisses you at Christmas timewhen you give her a plaster mold of your hand.

These things I wish for you - tough times and disappointment, hard work
and happiness.  To me, it's the only way to appreciate life.

Written with a pen.  Sealed with a kiss.  I'm here for you.  And if I
die before you do, I'll go to heaven and wait for you.

Send this to all of your friends.  We secure our friends, not by
accepting favors, but by doing them.

Paul Harvey

When asked this riddle, 80% of kindergarten kids got the answer,
compared to 17% of Stanford University seniors.
What is greater than God, More evil than the devil, The poor have it,
The rich need it, And if you eat it, you'll die?
Send this to 10 people and then press shift and you will get the
answer.
P.S.  You wont believe this, but this really does give you the
answer!!!!

Gerald,

Are you familiar with the above two projects?  Maricela Trevino (ext. 53681) and Gareth Bahlmann (37295) in Global Finance are trying to locate the attorney that worked on these two projects.  Last May I helped Roger Balog put together a crude confirmation for Lost Creek and that is the extent of my knowledge on that matter.  

Thanks.
Nony"

Woody,

Sorry for the delay in my response.  I was out on Tuesday & Wednesday.  I am

forwarding an email from Nancy Brock (below).  Does Enron wish to be paged

(if that's technically feasible), or would email satisfy Enron?

Subject: RE: ICAP / VELCO monthly peaks

I spoke with VY yesterday about notifying Enron.  We should work with Bobbi

(Bruce is far less willing to accommodate...).  Bobbi says she will be happy

to add Enron to the pager list as long as Enron has a VY pager that works in

Houston.  In the alternative, she will add Enron to the blast email. Since I

assume that Enron's email would be monitored 24/7 for this sort of thing,

that may be the cheapest and easiest way to go.  She said that emails are

not sent for every downpower (whereas pagers are notified for almost

everything), depending on severity.  I would say that next step is to

understand what can be done with an email and does it satisfy the Enron

needs.  If that doesn't work, we'll have to see about the pager.  I think

Bobbi wants to accommodate us, she just needs to understand what Enron

needs."

Kay

Here is an overview of what projects are active:

1.  Midway - Greg Krause

The hot item is a Property Owners Association Agreement that will be entered 
into between Midway Development Company, L.L.C. (""MDC"") and Cooney-Midway 
Groves (the owner of the property on which MDC has an option to purchase).  
The agreement will not be entered into or effective until MDC has given 
notice it will proceed with the project (and, thus, we control the trigger).  
I have asked Chris Boehler at A&K to turn a redline draft that incorporates 
changes that Greg and I discussed last week with he and Darren Inoff.   David 
Layman at Greenburg Traurig (our Florida counsel) also needs to incorporate 
some changes now that the platting has been done.  Chris is to send his 
redline to Greg, David and you.  David is to make his additions and then send 
a composite to Greg, you and Chris.  This will probably take a week or so and 
then it can go to the counterparty when everyone on our side is in agreement 
with the changes.  The biggest issue we have right now is that Cooney-Midway 
Groves wants to maintain control over the property as long as they own an 
interest in one of the tracts and we are not willing to allow that when we 
will own 2/3 of the property but have less than 1/2 of the vote.  This is 
because the agreement is designed to give one vote to each acre.  There are 
three tracts, of which CM will own one and MDC will own 2, but the 3rd tract 
is not alloted any votes since it must remain undeveloped land for a 
retention pond.

Chris is also working on some title commitment letters for the option we just 
secured from Clyde Thompson and Paul Freeman.  There's no rush on those and 
can definitely wait until I get back.

2.  Pompano - Steve Krimsky

Pompano has 2 issues that are hot.

1.  The infamous Developer's Agreement.  Debbie has turned another draft and 
has asked that we bless it before Thursday so that she can go visit with the 
city attorney on Friday.  The hearing in Pompano is scheduled for the evening 
of June 12 and you have indicated that you will attend.  I'll send them a 
note to tell them you'll be there.  We need to have a deal worked out with 
the Pompano commissioners before the public meeting.  The thing to keep in 
mind here is that in Pompano, unlike Deerfield, the same group that will be 
approving our request for a zoning change is the same group we have to 
negotiate the developer's agreement with.  Allegedly, they will settle for 
$1.5 MM in annual payments.  I've laid a copy of the agreement Debbie has 
prepared on your chair.

2.  In an effort to block the power plant project, Broward County has drafted 
a proposed ordinance that will place a moratorium on the approval of any 
power plant air permits until the matter can be studied at length.  The 
problem is, they expressly do not have the power to have any say in the air 
permit process.  That is expressly delegated to the Dept. of Environmental 
Protection (""DEP"").    However, the DEP hasn't taken the clean approach and 
said they have NO authority but it has stated that BC is entitled to 
reasonable rules and regulations and DEP will let them have some permit 
approvals; HOWEVER, air permits for power plants are expressly not delegated 
to BC.   Greenburg is probably a week away from being able to give us a legal 
opinion on the likelihood that Broward County will be able to do something 
that is legally defensible.  Once they started looking into this, it became 
quite the legal search because at one time BC did have the authority to pass 
special acts. However, in 1977 their special act authority was cut off but 
the legislature ratified all rules they had in effect at that time.  After 
that, they were granted charter power to adopt have such authority as a 
charter county to adopt their own home rules as long as they were not 
inconsistent with state or federal law or the constitution.  In 2000, they 
repealed all prior acts relating to the issuance of air permits and said they 
would rely on their charter power to make up their own rules.  Problem is, 
the DEP has expressly not given them the right to have a say in air permits 
for power plants.  Needless to say, this is sticky and icky.  My 
recommendation is that we don't jump out and incur litigation costs.  Let us 
get a memo together, go talk to the county attorney and show him that they 
don't have the right to do this.  The hearing on adopting this ordinance is 2 
p.m. on June 12, same day as the commissioner's meeting on the Developers 
Agreement.  Between now and June 12, Debbie Orshefsky would like to talk to 
the attorney and to the DEP.  Indications are that the DEP will strongly 
support us as this could be a turf battle for them.  The county attorney may 
come to his senses and advise the commission that passing such an ordinance 
will be costly as it is unenforceable if challenged.  We can also ask the DEP 
to issue a ""declaratory statement"" and it is likely that statement would say 
that state law is pre-emptive and the ordinance is invalid.

This is a very, very broad brush of what is a very legislative history 
intensive issue.  Debbie will be looking to you to read the memo that will 
come next week and agree on a strategy on going forward.

3.  Deerfield - Steve Krimsky

Unlike Pompano where the commissioners who vote on the rezoning are the same 
who vote on the developer's agreement, in Deerfield they don't have a say 
over any of the approval process.  However, to facilitate coming into the 
city, they expect something.  If we can agree on the form of developer's 
agreement, then it would be substantially used in the same manner in 
Deerfield.  In Deerfield, they have said they want 3 things:  a payment in 
lieu of taxes, a landscape fund to fund upkeep of a particular street (which 
is basically an adopt a street program and is required of any new business 
coming into Deerfield) and they want an easement to put a cellular tower on 
our property.  I've told Steve Krimsky the latter can be a headache because 
if they are successful in leasing the space on the tower to third parties, 
that creates a lot of traffic going across your property.  It is very 
do-able, we just need to structure it correctly. I've done several radio 
tower agreements and we can use those as go-bys.  They may also want a ""fire 
service fee"" if we give one to Pompano.  There's also lots and lots of 
negative publicity on a daily basis and Eric Thode is wanting to respond with 
an editorial in the Sun-Sentinel.  I'll forward the most recent version they 
have been sharing amongst themselves and not we lawyers.  The hearing in 
Deerfield is June 8th and you may want to attend it as well.  

I'll copy my notes for you.  THANK YOU for covering for me.  Here are  
numbers you can send e-mails to or call and leave a message:

Walter and Marlena Schilling  011 49 8218 89351 schilling.jun@freenet.de

Monika and Bernhard Steinacher 011 49 8232 8932 m.steinacher@schwabmuenchen.de

Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak pretty good 
English and Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena doesn't speak it very well so ask 
for Walter.  Bavaria is 7 hours ahead of Houston.  "

FYI:

Sue stopped by and wanted to discuss your email re: launching missiles over 
email to the world.  

I told her that 1) folks are understandably sensitive regarding the info that 
gets to commercial folks, 2) she should continue sending those notes out and 
3) she should restrict the distribution list for such notes to GA, which 
gives the team a chance to discuss the issues and to decide what info to push 
out to commercial folks, and avoids rather everyone just willy-nilly sending 
out notes and potentially getting commercial folks whipped up into an 
(unintentional and  unnecessary) frenzy.  I think she took it well and I 
think she'll make a practice.  Only time will tell."

Change in plans - Patti will send slides for both me and Beth.  She is formating info from Beth's assistant into format that I used for my slides, so you will get these as one presentation.  (Patti has already sent my slides so that you can begin the process of making copies for the binders.)  I think that you already have slides from Tom on CommodityLogic.  We are working on a few slides for the Commercialization Effort - will have those ready as soon as we can.   Thanks, Tina. --Sally

*********************************************************

Cold November weather, with heating degree-days 22 percent above normal 
through
the twenty-fifth, fueled withdrawals from storage that CERA estimates will 
average
approximately 8.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day for the month, near the 
all-time
record for November set in 1995. This is approximately 5.0 Bcf per day higher 
than
the previously expected withdrawal rate under normal weather conditions. The 
result
is that storage inventories as of the end of the month are about 500 Bcf 
below the
year-earlier level and are on track to dip well into record low territory by 
the end of
the winter (see Table 1).

For December, normal weather would result in storage withdrawals of 17.0 Bcf 
per
day on average for the month. At that rate, storage inventories would fall 
below 2.0
trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the year, the first time that has 
ever occurred.
By the end of March CERA expects working inventories to be reduced to 606 Bcf 
in
the United States, compared with the previous record low of 758 Bcf.

This weather and high withdrawal rates have moved prices higher within the 
wide
and volatile range between residual fuel oil and distillate, with gas prices 
moving
farther above those of resid ($4.75 to $5.00) and closer to the price of 
distillate fuel
oil (approximately $7.00). Strength in the oil market has kept the 
resid-distillate
range high, but should gas test either boundary of this range, the price of 
either
distillate or resid would move as well. Under normal weather CERA now expects
December prices to average $6.25 at the Henry Hub, a higher level within this 
range
reflective of reduced storage inventories.

Although prices have abated somewhat in recent days and will continue to rise 
and
fall with weather and weather forecasts, fundamentals now are so tight that a 
return
to cold weather would quickly drive prices back above $6.50 and potentially 
above
$7.00 at the Henry Hub. It is only at that level or above that any significant
additional demand response is likely, and even then such a response would 
require
time. The possibility of curtailments of interruptible loads late this winter 
has grown,
while the possibility of significant price relief appears increasingly remote.

Even though I'm a Bush/Cheney supporter, I had to pass this one along...



George Bush and Dick Cheney are enjoying a celebration dinner at a fancy 
Washington restaurant. Their waitress approaches their table tom take their 
order, and she is GORGEOUS.

She asks Cheney what he wants, and he replies,   ""I'll have the heart-healthy 
salad.""

""Very good, sir,"" she replies, and turning to Bush she asks,

""And what do you want, Mr. President?""

Bush answers, ""How about a quickie?""

Taken aback, the waitress slaps him and says,   ""I'm shocked and disappointed 
in you. I thought you were bringing in a new administration that was 
committed to high principles and  morality. I'm sorry I voted for you.""

With that, the waitress departed in a huff. Cheney leans over to Bush,and 
says, ""Mr. President, I believe that's pronounced 'quiche'

Steve:

Attached is a series of press releases by MG Plc regarding their metals 
website, the first of which was launched on or about October 4, 1999.

I also have a message in to the attorneys at Enron that worked closely on the 
acquisition, but one of our commercial people understands the site to be an 
on-line brokerage system (like E*Trade) -- the press release on the launch of 
the system (at the bottom of this message) indicates that the site is an LME 
trading and execution system.  I'll forward over any other information I can 
find.     




USA: Metal exchanges hold firm as Web trading blooms.

06/22/2000
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2000. 

NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - The world's two largest metal exchanges said 
they will retain their roles despite the rapid expansion in Internet trading 
and as another major metal dealer announced the launch of an online trading 
system on Thursday. 
The London Metal Exchange (LME) is carefully planning its introduction of 
electronic trading in the second-half of this year and refuses to be 
""spooked"" by those ""urging action, any action, as long as it is now,"" 
Jonathan Haslam, LME director of corporate affairs, told a conference in New 
York.
His comments were echoed by Patrick Thompson, president of the New York 
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), who said it would be very difficult for the new 
online trading systems to bring together those elements that underpinned the 
success of the traditional exchanges. 
Thompson told the Metal Bulletin E-Commerce 2000 conference that said these 
elements included the handling of counterparty credit risk, the clearing of 
trades and the existing pools of liquidity provided by the different segments 
of the metals market which use the exchanges. 
Haslam compared the LME's trading turnover averaging $8 billion a day with 
the around $1.5 billion a day traded online by U.S. energy giant Enron Corp. 
. 
Enron's expansion in the e-commerce market was earlier referred to by Thomas 
Pimpinelli, senior vice president of MG London Inc. part of U.K.-based metals 
trading group MG Plc . In May, MG agreed to a 300 pence per share cash offer 
from Enron. 
Pimpinelli said MG's own MITS online metals trading system, launched in 
October 1999, has to date processed over 135,000 contracts with an overall 
value of $5.25 billion. 
He told the meeting that between 65 percent to 80 percent of MG's order flow, 
mostly from small metals clients, was now done over the Internet. 
Pimpinelli said the success of its ""Market Maker"" real-time trading facility 
within MITS for tonnages of up to a 1,000 tonnes, had encouraged the company 
to create a new product for the Managed Futures industry called ""CTA Trader."" 
The product will differ from Market Maker in that the customer can trade 
larger volumes, request a volume quote on-line, and then have the facility to 
book the resulting live on-line quote. 
""Once executed the customers will need to breakdown or allocate the 
transaction to his individual or multiple pre-approved clearing houses by way 
of a dropdown menu,"" he said. Pimpinelli added that CTA Trader would be 
launched in the next month or so. 
Sharing a platform with Pimpinelli, Karl Hackert, head of e-commerce at U.S. 
trader Koch Metals, announced the impending launch of his company's own 
online metals trading system by the end of June. Koch metals is a unit of 
Koch Industries Inc. . 
Hackert said the issue of the LME's daily forward prices valuation at 5.30 
p.m. in London, meant that the level of these quotes wasn't clear during the 
rest of the trading day. Under the new Koch system prices will be updated 
every five seconds and out to 27 months. 
""Koch are the first to do this (offer near real-time forward prices) and it 
is a big step forward in terms of market transparency,"" he said. 
Hackert said Koch had built its system to better communicate with its clients 
and it did not intend to go into direct competition with the LME. 
""Making a generic mass system? I don't think that's the business we're in,"" 
he said.

UK: UPDATE 2-MG to widen access to online metals trade.
By Andy Blamey

06/13/2000
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2000. 

LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - U.K.-based metals trading group MG plc said on 
Tuesday it would broaden access to its online metals trading systems as the 
battle for web pre-eminence comes to the boil. 
MG, one of the world's leading metals traders, said it would allow London 
Metal Exchance clearing members to use the system, which had been restricted 
to clients, with immediate effect.
The move comes in response to strong demand for access to the system, an MG 
spokesman said. MG has so far signed up 14 Category One (ring dealing) and 
Category Two (associate broker clearing) members of the LME. 
""We have decided to broaden the availability of Market Maker following the 
rapid increase in volumes and substantial uptake by both existing and new 
clients,"" said Michael Hutchinson, CEO of MG's Financial Services Division in 
a statement. 
""We are confident that we have an online product which will meet demand from 
other clearing members of the LME."" 
The wider access to MG's system need not necessarily pose a threat to other 
online marketplaces, said Gavin Gross, head of LME metals at brokerage 
Spectron Futures Ltd. Spectron plans to launch online systems to trade London 
Metal Exchange contracts later this month. 
""They're very different models. MG is a principal in the market, so you're 
looking at MG prices only. Spectron is neutral, we're just providing a 
platform. It's a multilateral system with lots of dealers interacting with 
each other,"" Gross said. 
""The two can exist side by side,"" he added. 
Over 80 percent of MG's clients are now using its online services, the 
company said. Market Maker turnover stood at 3,000 contracts in May - a 
growth rate of approximately 50 percent per month since the launch in January 
of this year. 
Online deals still make up a low proportion of MG's total trading turnover, 
however. 
MG's MITS system launched in October 1999 and has now processed over 95,000 
contracts with a dollar value in excess of $3.8 billion and a monthly 
turnover in excess of $1 billion. 
""We are using it (MITS) for the one or two lot small stop orders that you 
previously missed and had the customer ringing up asking if we had done his 
trade,"" said one user of an MG system at an ABCM. 
However, it would appear that MG is now limiting the size of the orders it 
will accept on MITS from its non-customers, he said. 
Metals e-commerce sites are proliferating, but they follow no single business 
model. There are portals run by single principals quoting their own prices; 
intranets where big market players are cooperating; different rules for 
access; and a wide variation in revenue models, the key to profitability. 
The company announced in March it had joined Internet Capital Group and 
Safeguard International Fund to form the EMETRA joint venture, in which MG 
has a 25 percent stake. 
EMETRA is building a worldwide business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce 
marketplace for the non-ferrous metals markets, including physical trading a 
futures and options contracts. 
MG contributed its Internet systems to EMETRA and continues to use MITS and 
Market Maker under a licence agreement with EMETRA. 
In May, MG agreed a 300 pence per share cash offer from U.S. energy and 
communications group Enron, a major player in the e-commerce market through 
Enron Online, which trades around 840 products in some 13 countries in 11 
currencies.

US Enron Bid For MG May Signal End Of LME Outcry Trading
By Adam Aljewicz

05/23/2000
Dow Jones International News 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron's (ENE) offer to buy London Metal Exchange ring 
dealing firm MG PLC (U.MGA) could bring the exchange one step closer to 
ending open outcry trading, dealers say. 
Both the U.S.-based energy and communications group, and MG have pioneered 
electronic trading and are widely seen as being among the only participants 
on the LME trading floor capable of making the transition to on-screen 
trading. The LME, meanwhile, is also seeking to introduce on-screen 
technology for out-of-ring trading sessions.
""We're not surprised in the least to see this tie-up take place,"" an analyst 
at Deutsche Bank told Dow Jones Newswires. ""Everything we see now is pointing 
toward the removal of the ring-dealing sessions, and it's just a matter of 
time before it ends all together,"" she said. 
MG's chairman Tom McKeever said the company won't abandon its position as an 
LME ring dealing member, but market watchers doubt whether - after 123 years 
- open outcry can survive on the LME as fast-paced technological change 
sweeps through the industry. 
Enron has made a GBP300 million cash offer for London-based MG in a bid to 
gain a foothold in the $120 billion-a-year world metal market. The U.S. 
company already has a substantial market share in natural gas and electricity 
markets, and with its electronic trading platform, Enron On Line, it has 
already executed more than 110,000 transactions valued at over $45 billion 
since its launch in November. 
""It's not surprising to see a strategic link up between an energy and metals 
company because they're both very big in industrial commodities,"" said an 
analyst for a U.S.-based commission house. ""I think it's almost inevitable 
that open outcry trading will be a thing of the past,"" he said. 
Enron's move into the metals market has also been linked to the LME's growing 
interest in initiating an automated trading system, and has lead some market 
watchers to suggest that the Enron-MG tie-up will lead to greater 
consolidation among LME members. 
Metals trading companies and brokerage firms are struggling to survive as 
profits wane amid the growth of banks and funds in the metals trading arena. 
""Out of the 13 ring dealing firms on the LME, I think only six will be able 
to make the transition to on-screen trading,"" said a dealer for a 
London-based bank. ""And that's only because we have a banking background,"" he 
said. 
The six cited are MG, the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia, 
U.S.-based brokerage Refco Inc., Credit Lyonnais Rouse, Barclays Capital and 
Fimat Metals. 
The LME's existing system involves the trading of eight metals within its 
circular trading floor. Around 35% of the LME's trading takes place there, 
but this figure could drop if the LME decides to abandon open outcry, traders 
say. ""Market participants will have to decide whether to use the ring 
or go through the Internet,"" said a dealer. ""That's how it will start
and will probably lead to the trading floor being bypassed
altogether."" 

MG, which was spun off from Germany's Metallgesellschaft last September, has 
pioneered the use of metals trading on the Internet with the launch in 
October of MITS and MARKET MAKER, its Internet trading system. 
MG is the second-largest physical merchant of copper, nickel and aluminum in 
Europe after Switzerland's Glencore. 
""When profit margins are narrowing and so many LME companies are looking more 
and more uncertain about their future, MG (is) arguably the pick of the crop 
in terms of stability and profitably,"" said a dealer for a North 
American-owned ring dealing firm. LME Considers Screen Trading 

Separately, the LME has considered a series of moves that would also hasten 
the demise of open outcry trading. 
It has repeatedly said it is looking to develop an electronic screen-trading 
system for use in out of ring trading sessions, and that it plans to press 
ahead with changes to its ownership structure by demutualizing in favor of 
becoming a shareholder entity. 
""We've made very clear that there are proposals for consequential changes to 
the LME's governance,"" said Jonathan Haslam, director of corporate affairs at 
the LME. 
The LME set up an eight-member committee in February which comprised four 
ring dealing members and four associate broker members to map out a strategy 
for the implementation of new technology. 
However, it has so far declined to comment on how this technology will be 
executed, although Haslam has said the LME is looking at around 20 companies 
with the requisite knowledge and background to provide and implement the 
on-screen technology. 
""We said we would look into setting up an interoffice screen trading system 
but we have yet to come to a decision on who our technical partner will be,"" 
he said. ""But we should come to a decision in a couple of weeks.""

MG exceeds $1B Internet trade target

LONDON - International metals trader MG PLC said yesterday that business on 
its six-month old Internet trading systems had comfortably exceeded its 
transaction value target of $1-billion (all figures in U.S. dollars). 
""We are at $1.5-billion as of this morning. We are are very pleased with the 
progress and the rate of growth,"" said Tom McKeever, MG chairman.
He noted that online trading in metals is seen growing rapidly, according to 
a recent study by Anderson Consulting. Just 2% to 3% of business in the 
non-ferrous industry is currently conducted online, while in three to five 
years it will be 40% to 60%, he said. 
Since the launch in October, volumes on MG's internet systems, known as MITS 
and MARKET MAKER, have increased by 50% a month and cumulatively exceed 
30,000 contracts now. 
MG said it had also gained customers as its systems are the only ones that 
currently offer online trading. ""When we launched the system, we had requests 
from many new customers to register. We registered quite a few new customers. 
It is beyond our expectations,"" Mr. McKeever added. 
The increase in on-line business on MITS has been seen round the clock as 
customers have become increasingly comfortable with the system. 
""We were the first to start the system. It has been late coming to the metals 
business, but we think it is good for the industry,"" he said. 
Last month, MG announced it had joined Internet Capital Group and Safeguard 
International Fund to form an eMetra joint venture in which it has a 25% 
stake.

MG PLC - Trading Update

MG INTERNET TRADING UPDATE 
MG announces that in the first six months of trading on its Internet systems, 
MITS and MARKET MAKER, it has surpassed its target of US $1 billion in value 
of transactions. The volume of transactions has been increasing by 50% a 
month since October and cumulatively exceeds 30,000 contracts.
The trading systems have attracted new customers as well as MG's existing 
customers because it is the only system currently available that offers them 
an on-line LME trading and execution service. 
The launch of MITS was announced in October 1999 by MG. In February, MG 
announced that it had joined with Internet Capital Group and Safeguard 
International Fund to form the eMetra joint venture, in which MG has a 25% 
stake. eMetra is in the process of establishing a worldwide 
business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce marketplace for the non-ferrous metals 
markets, including physical trading and the trading of futures and options 
contracts. MG contributed its Internet systems to eMetra and continues to use 
MITS and MARKET MAKER under a licence agreement with eMetra. Once eMetra is 
fully operational later this year, MG will become a user of eMetra's 
platform. 
Michael Hutchinson, Joint Chief Executive of MG plc, said: ""We are delighted 
that so many customers to date have transferred their business on to the 
Internet - we see this trend as increasing significantly in the coming 
months. It is proving attractive to new customers and enables us to give our 
existing customers a more efficient service.""

City: MG plans to launch metals website
James Ashton

02/11/2000
The Daily Telegraph 
Copyright (C) 2000 The Daily Telegraph; Source: World Reporter (TM) 

MG, the international metals trader, yesterday unveiled plans to develop an 
internet marketplace for trading non-ferrous metals, in direct competition 
with the London Metals Exchange (LME). 
The joint venture with the Internet Capital Group (ICG) and private equity 
fund Safeguard International will establish a worldwide business-to-business 
e-commerce platform for non-ferrous metals. This will include physical 
trading and the trading of options and futures contracts.
MG shares soared 140 1/2 to 337 1/2 p. 
""We didn't go into this venture intending to put anyone out of business,"" 
said chairman Thomas McKeever. 
He added that the as-yet-unnamed new venture would attract new clients, 
particularly small and medium-sized companies who regard conventional LME 
trade as too costly and complex. 
He said he also hoped to open up the derivatives market to smaller players. 
""When you develop a global marketplace you attract, presumably, most industry 
participants,"" he added. 
Safeguard and Nasdaq-listed ICG, which already has stakes in more than 50 
companies offering online trading in sectors such as industrial chemicals, 
plastics and cattle, have invested a total of $25 million in the venture, 
taking 30 and 45pc stakes respectively. 
MG, the world's largest copper merchant, will hold an initial 25pc, with an 
option to increase that to 50pc within eight months. The company, which 
floated last September at 205p, after being spun off from German engineering 
group Metallgesellschaft, will continue to operate its internet trading 
system Mits for existing customers. It began live internet dealing of 
aluminium and copper in January.

MG expects MITS to be a hit.
CHRISTIAN KOHL

1999 Cahners Publishing Company 

DUSSELDORF -- Only one week after London Metal Exchange trader 
Metallgesellschaft Ltd. launched its web site system that allows trade 
execution services on the Internet, it is optimistic that the concept will be 
a hit. 
""It's been quite extraordinary,"" said Alex Health, MG's director of 
e-commerce systems. ""We've had something like 300 reactions so far from both 
existing customer companies as well as new ones logging on."" He said that the 
non-customers entering MG'S site (www.mgltd.co.uk) ranged from large groups 
MG had wanted to make contact with for a longtime to small companies that 
Heath said he'd never heard of. 

""Of course, it's LME Week now, so we are busy with socializing and making 
contacts there before we can reply to the requests we've received,"" Heath 
said. He noted that LME Week was one important factor in launching the 
Metallgesellschaft Internet Trading System (MITS) in time to display it at 
Broker's House by Tuesday evening. MG Plc's recent floatation also provided a 
major motivation for the project to raise MG's profile, he said: 
Heath said that MITS has not had an immediate effect on trading volumes 
beyond the regular market, activity, but 70. customers so far had used the 
facility for deals. He added that MITS might soon contribute to MG's customer 
base, but it would take some time for new parties attracted to the site to be 
registered as regular customers. 
At the beginning of LME Week, few LME trading companies were prepared to 
comment on MITS and its possible effect on metals trading. MG's presentations 
at the LME event were aimed at providing a clearer picture. ""I'd be extremely 
disappointed if the idea didn't spread as the Internet will inevitably be a 
big factor in trading,"" Heath said. He noted that MG put itself under 
pressure by moving before some other company with a similar 
project-in-the-making could enter the scene. 
""Speed is a definite factor in the Internet, and we can claim to be leading 
into the new millennium in this regard,"" he said, adding that MG received 
many ""flattering comments"" from brokers. 
Peter Sellars of Barclays Bank Plc conceded that ""certainly they got there 
before anybody else"" but added that ""they won't have very much of a lead 
time."" He said that the Internet was going to be the way of the future and 
that Barclays was making similar preparations, but so far offered a web site 
order trading system only for non-metallic futures. He noted, however, that 
web site trading would not satisfy all requirements. ""It's great for the 
small bread-and-butter stuff, but for long-term contracts it's gonna be 
tricky, isn't it,"" Sellars said. 
A spokesman at Triland Metals Ltd., another LME member, questioned whether MG 
was really embracing technology or vice versa. ""It could be a gimmick for 
customers, and it doesn't really mean they're successful with enlarging their 
customer base,"" he said. He noted that people were always interested in 
coming close but weren't necessarily keen on taking the final step. He said 
that Triland had no immediate plans for a similar service and that it was 
confining its web site plans to statistics and other basic information. ""They 
jumped the gun to a certain extent, but we'll have to see if it's successful 
or not.""

European & Emerging Markets
MG Launches First Internet Metals Trade Service
A Wall Street Journal Europe Roundup

The Wall Street Journal Europe

(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

LONDON -- MG PLC has launched the first Internet-based metals futures trading 
system. 
MG, which went public on the London Stock Exchange in September, offers a 
full trading and execution service on the London Metals Exchange.
The system, which is called MITS, will be supported by a real-time price 
screen for all the metals traded on the LME and includes a multi-currency 
facility. The LME trades copper, aluminium, lead, zinc, nickel, tin, silver 
and aluminium alloy. 
In addition, customers can listen to a direct voice commentary from the floor 
of the LME during trading sessions. 
Technical analysis and market research on all LME metals is available and 
regularly updated. Customers can also access their position and valuation 
statements over a secure encrypted link to the firm's computer system. 
MITS can only be accessed by registered customers of Metallgesellsc haft 
Limited, MG's LME brokerage and trading arm. 
""It is a customer service and it is live now to our registered customers,"" 
said Michael Hutchinson, MG's joint chief executive. 
MG's customers will also be able to listen to a direct-voice commentary from 
the floor of the LME during trading sessions. They will also be able to 
access their position and valuation statements over a secure encrypted link 
to MG's computer system, MG said. 
The LME is the world's largest non-ferrous metals market with 14 ring-dealing 
members who participate in the twice-daily important open-outcry sessions. 
The LME settlement prices for metals which are realized in the official 
morning trading sessions are the benchmark reference prices for most of the 
world's physical contracts. 
Outside the open-outcry sessions, LME business takes place over a 24-hour 
period via an inter-office telephone market. 
""We are always interested in any new uses of technology. We will watch this 
with interest,"" an LME spokeswoman said. 
MG said it intended to develop its website to eventually include real-time 
physical metal prices and premiums. 
MG's system is the latest in a series of Internet commodity trading systems.

2.  Under ""Contact"" it should be more than a form to email in.  Add

Just my thoughts.  I liked your previous site (from a user-friendliness

Effective, February 1, 2001, ENW Contractors are required to utilize the SAP/CATS systems to record all time worked.  Each Cost Center Owner is responsible for keeping track of their Contractors' hours on a monthly basis, as well as ensuring Contractor compliance with this mandate.

At the end of each month, ENW Accounting is providing Contractor reporting to Office of the Chair.  However, the accuracy of this report is dependent on Contractors entering their time into SAP.

As a result, going forward, a second ""non-compliance"" report will be submitted to Office of the Chair on a monthly basis, detailing Contractors not entering their time and the Contractor supervisor.  Please contact Diane Latson (X5-7184) if you believe your contractors are exceptions and should not be entering time.

Contractor Time Entry

Contractors are required to enter their time in eHRonline to one of the following: (1) project numbers, which are called WBS Elements; (2) cost centers, which are associated to a specific department and not a formal project.  It is the Supervisor's responsibility to ensure Contractors are provided with the proper project or cost center coding.

Unlike invoice coding, SAP will only accept a Cost Center or WBS element number for each time entry line.  This means that you cannot enter a Cost Center and a WBS element number on the same line.  SAP will read this information from left to right and will only pick up the first entry.  For example:

		CostCenter		WBS Element			
		123456		c.9999.99.99.99		

The system will look at this entry and all time will be charged as expense to Cost Center 123456. 

Any questions regarding  time entry coding should be directed to ISC HR support x5-4727."

Ken,

I have been working to put together the business agenda for the Management 
Conference in November.  The theme I am proposing is ""Reinventing Enron ... 
Again!""  I believe the theme is timely as we celebrate our 15 year history 
and address significant changes for the future.  

Attached is a draft of the agenda for your review.  I had an opportunity to 
run it by Jeff last week.  He was happy with the theme and the first day's 
schedule.  He asked that we keep the second day open given the changes that 
will likely develop between now and November.  He felt the second day might 
best be used to establish a new ""manifest"" for the company.   We will, of 
course, remain flexible.  However, I am showing you the agenda as Jeff saw it 
as an example of how the day might run.

Also, on the first day, we'd like to have a spokesperson from Blockbuster 
speak between Tom Peters and Gary Hamil.  Mr. Peters will help set the theme 
by discussing the need for successful companies to reinvent themselves.  Mr. 
Hamil will present tactical strategies for innovation.  Our thought is that a 
Blockbuster spokesperson could discuss their company's experience with 
reinvention -- they are in an interesting situation as the delivery 
mechanisms for their products are evolving.  Would you recommend we invite 
John Antioco, chairman & CEO, or Mark Gilman, president of New Media?  
Several have indicated that Mr. Gilman would be a more provocative speaker 
and better equipped to address the theme of reinvention.

I look forward to your feedback and/or suggestions.

Thanks,
Terrie James

Steven,

Thank you for visiting with my class at Rice last night. They thoroughly
enjoyed your talk -- after you left for the evening, we had a good
discussion on topics that you had raised. My apologies again for the room
mix up; somehow between myself, the university, and my secretary, the
classroom assignment changed several times and the update did not get to
you.

Next year, if your schedule permits, perhaps you would consider a return
engagement. I would certainly enjoy having you back.

Regards,
John

Rick:

Thanks for the note to David.  It had the desired impact as David walked 
around first thing and was very appreciative.  As I said before, this is the 
right message in this situation based on the actions taken by David which now 
tend to get a bit lost in the current noise (ie. exposure having now 
increased to $ 18 MM). 

Relative to the M-to-M, David had questioned both Beasley and Sweeney (Comm. 
Suppt.) about the M-to-M starting well before the September pre-pay of 2.8 to 
Vnesh.  Beasley said the prudency would cover the exposure while Sweeney 
simply evaded the questions and was not forthcoming.  Sweeney's responses 
were most curious as I understand he's among the strongest in Commercial 
Support and my experience with him to date is consistent with this view.  We 
learned in the last couple of days that e-mails were circulating within 
Liquids (commercial support and commercial) back to early summer concerning 
the situation and need to hold the prudency (first booked in July).  Hardy 
did not press for copies of these e-mails yesterday since, at this point, it 
would not be terribly productive  but I find it very troubling that this kind 
of communication was taking place so early in the process and all involved 
were not informed beyond those close to Beasley.  The key issue here is that 
David was asking for the information at the right time but was kept out of 
the loop (not that his exposure reports did not include the M-to-M starting 
in Nov. when we learned of the magnitude of the problem).  In hindsight, we 
should not have allowed the Sept. 2.8 pre-pay to Vnesh until we had received 
a satisfactory response.  However, given the fact that David was asking the 
right people, it is unreasonable for anyone to be critical of his actions in 
the least.  

Thoughts or questions?

David- Would rather have done this by phone but there is no chance for the 
next couple of days so I thought I would send you an e-mail. 

Steve tells me that the message from Helsinki investigation has been 
misinterpreted by you and you are feeling like you have been unjustly blamed 
for at least part of the problem here. This is not how this situation is 
being thought of here, as a matter of fact we in RAC are quite pleased with 
the level of coverage on this deal from the outset and I believe it was RAC 
that started sounding warning bells long before any other group did.

Your coverage of this deal has been of the highest level. All of us should 
have picked up on the MTM vs cash issue but the DASH clearly stated that the 
pre  pay was the determining control here which was monitored carefully and 
nicely plotted historically. We could not produce that result in any other 
area where we do business.

In any event, your performance is not being called into question here in the 
least and you should take pride in the fact that we were on top of this deal 
from the outset. 


Having said all that, I believe there are some valuable lessons that RAC 
needs to learn here and I think we need a meeting to discuss these. I think 
one of the biggest problems here was that strong detective measures, AA 
audit, RAC issues, etc were pointed out to commercial people and basically 
ignored. This is what we have to focus on. More about this later.

In the mean time, continue to focus on this. It is a good lesson for the rest 
of the group to amplify how important what we do is. 

Keep up good work and have a beer. 

Cheers, Rick

Mike and Jeff,

We're planning to meet with XL Capital in NYC on Thursday to discuss 
EnronCredit.com.  John S. suggested I notify the two of you and (a) inform 
you of the meeting and (b) determine whether there was any outstanding 
litigation between XL and ENE due to the weather derivatives team.

Regards,
John

Steve and Bob,

There is a clear assumption in the email history below that suggests that t=
here is a relationship between EFS buying the existing projects under the G=
SA contract and a potential adverse affect on the GSA commodity portion of =
the commodity risk book.  This is not the case.  The potential adverse affe=
ct on the commodity risk book would exist regardless of whether or not EFS =
bought the projects.  That is, if there were no change to the internal stru=
cture of the contract and EES went forward as if nothing had happened, then=
 the issue of this potential adverse affect would still exist.  It would ex=
ist as an internal EES problem which would have to be resolved because we h=
ave an existing contract with the VA.  This commodity risk issue would not =
exist only if we were going to terminate all the VA projects.  But, as far =
as I know, there has never been serious consideration to terminating the pr=
ojects....if for no other reason we have no right to unilaterally terminate=
.  Only the government has that right.

The important point here is that this issue is not an issue pertinent to th=
e indemnification issue.  Whatever needs to be done to complete the indemni=
fication process should proceed uninterrupted.  Once the indemnification ha=
s been resolved, then as a separate matter, EES and EFS should address what=
 affect the projects have on the commodity book.  They are separate issues =
and would have to be resolved independent of any indemnification issue. =20

Bottom line is that by relating the two issues (i.e. the issue of the proje=
cts' affect on the commodity book with the issue of indemnification), someo=
ne has created unnecessary confusion. =20

Just thought I'd add my two cents....

Rogers,

Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. (""EESO"") and General Services Admini=
stration (""GSA"") entered into an agreement, effective November 1, 1998, whi=
ch provides for commodity pricing and value added services, specifically re=
lated to GSA Region 1 -New England and runs through October 31, 2003.  EESO=
 agreed to provide a ""Discount to Standard Offer"" commodity price for GSA's=
 ""Core Load"" associated with facilities in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and=
 Rhode Island at such time as the utilities met certain conditions regardin=
g deregulation (State commission formally approves UDC's restructuring plan=
 and State Commission formally approves the UDC's sale of non-nuclear gener=
ating assets).  Individual agencies that have elected to participate under =
the GSA agreement are: Veterans Administration, Coast Guard, National Parks=
 Service, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Agriculture, National Arc=
hives and Records Administration, Hanscom Air Force Base, and Department of=
 Labor, with the total core group consisting of approximately 60 MW's.  The=
 UDC's that have met the above referenced criteria above are Massachusetts =
UDC's (MECO, BECO WMECO, Fitchburg Gas & Electric, Eastern Utilities, and C=
ommonwealth Electric, Cambridge Electric Company) and Rhode Island UDC (Nar=
ragansett Electric).  The only location where EESO currently delivers physi=
cal commodity is Massachusetts - BECO, which represent approximately fifty =
percent of the total ""Core Load"" or approximately 30 MW's and commenced in =
October 2000.

The agreement has provided other commodity upsell opportunities such as (i)=
 physical delivery of comodity GSA accounts and Coast Guard accounts in Mai=
ne behind Central Maine Power (June 2000 thru October 2003)  and (ii) sale =
and delivery of ""renewable energy"" to GSA and Hanscom Air Force Base (Octob=
er 2000 thru December 2001, with opportunity to extend thru October 2003).

Value Added Services under the agreement has been responsible for (i) solar=
 panel project development and installation (ii) cogeneration project devel=
opment and installation (in progress) (iii) chilled water project and (iv) =
maintenance agreement, all which total additional 50-55 million dollars.  E=
ESO had asked GSA to allow the contract to be split between commodity and v=
alue added services and GSA refused. A decision was made that would allow E=
nron Facilities Services (EFS) to perform the value added services portion =
of the contract, on behalf of EESO.  To the best of my knowledge the cogene=
ration projects would affect only the Veterans Administration sites, behind=
 Massachusetts-BECO only. =20

There is another issue that we can discuss at your convenience which relvol=
ves around the Master Subcontracting Plan and the requirement, in the last =
two years of the agreement for EESO to spend 1 million each year of the las=
t two years of the agreement utilizing small business concerns, small disad=
vantaged business concerns, and women-owned small business concerns.

Let me know if you would like to discuss any of the above referenced inform=
ation.

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Charles

I am OK with your simplifications. There was indeed repetition. There is still some redundancy at the very end (Are forward markets irrelevant?). But I think it does not hurt.

I think the graph Mike included needs some further explanation. It is not self-explanatory.

As per my conversation with Christi this morning, I will NOT contact Larry Ruff until I hear from you guys.

 I understand that you will be discussing this paper with Doug Gilbert today. Please let me know if I can be of any help. I am availablt today and tomorrow.

Vince, I am quite grateful. Thanks for arranging this.

By the way, is there any chance that I might be able to attract you to campus this spring before school lets out?  If not, let's definitely plan on scheduling a time during the coming fall 2001 semester when you can visit campus and present a lecture to my risk management students.

Sincerely,

Subject: enovate documents

The following documents are attached:

1)  Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement between enovate and PetroCanada.  I 
have made the following changes to Mary's document:
 a) effective date of November 1st, 2000 to coincide with the start of the 
transaction,
 b) notification for nominations/confirmations, and 
 c) signature line from enovate to enovate by Enron MW.

Jeff - Can you please print out two copies of this document, initial and have 
your assistant deliver them to Janet for execution.  Janet will be leaving 
for the management conference on Wednesday around noon so the earlier in the 
morning the better.  I will then have Janet's assistant get them back to me 
for delivery to PetroCanada.



2)  Audit Waiver

Kay - Can you please print out two copies, initial and I suppose your 
assistant can coordinate with Jeff's to make the delivery to Janet.  I will 
take care of getting Bill's signature.



Thank you both for your assistance.  Any questions or comments, let me know.

Gregg

Enron In Talks With 3 Financial Companies For Joint Venture 
Updated: Monday, December 3, 2001 06:52 PM ET 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. is negotiating with three financial institutions of ""impeccable creditworthiness"" regarding a joint venture aimed at restarting its trading operation, said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer for the company. 
Enron expects to announce its joint venture partner within weeks, according to Bienenstock. 
The joint venture would use that institution's financial means to guarantee that Enron would pay its bills. 
Also Monday, at a court hearing Enron announced $1.5 billion in debtor in possession financing from a syndicate led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
The company said that it needs about $250 million for immediate operating needs. Currently, Enron has about $500 million in cash.

Hey there! Congrats with Scott William. I hope all is going well. Fifteen days and counting till our third arrival. I've attached the DASH that documented the divestiture. The quick summary of the economics per Heather Kroll are as follows:

Original Basis of $8mm.
Signed the Purchase and Sale Agreement on May 16 for $22mm (gain of $14mm)

Sold put for $3.5mm with $1.7mm granted to origination. I don't know for sure what the desk booked.
The coal supply contract resulted in $5mm mark to market to EGM.

The FERC 203 filing has been made regarding market power. They are not expecting any issues with FERC or the North Carolina commission and expect final approval by the beginning of July.

Net gain of about $21mm on transaction.

Chris Lee, the managing partner of Highstar, has requested the opportunity to take you and I out to dinner sometime after you've returned and settled back in to discuss the merits of Enron's investment in Highstar. If that's of interest let me know and I can schedule some time.

Once again, congratulations. Do you have an expected return date yet?
Joe

Vince. This is good but I also need a title. It would be good if you can as
part of the talk present an example of a technical problem addressed by your
group describing the problem and the general methodology employed or
developed. You can also start with an introduction about your organization
and the program.

Bankruptcy in California; Implications for our Growth Energy Names

* We would not sell Energy Merchants/Power Producers on news that PCG
has declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
* Ongoing payments in California are being made by the state;
therefore do not anticipate material exposure for ongoing earnings.
* Primary exposure is current receivables: (1) these one-time amounts
are limited (roughly estimate max. of 50% of 2001 earnings); and (2) we
expect that, as trade creditors, they will get high priority in a bankruptcy
proceeding. We think most of these amounts are likely to be recoverable,
although a significant (perhaps several year) delay is possible as these
claimants work their way through the bankruptcy process.
* By our rough estimation, companies with fairly significant one-time
earnings exposure include:  NRG, MIR, DYN, CPN.  Companies with fairly small
exposure include:  ENE, AES, WMB, EPG and DUK.

Subject: OTC commodity derivative


We contacted the responsible officers of the BOK and confirmed that the BOK 
received 7 or 8 reports since April last year (when the rules changed) 
regarding OTC commodity derivative transactions and all of them were filed by 
Hyundai Oil Refinery in connection with oil derivatives.  It appears those 
reports were accepted by the BOK.  The review and processing of the reports 
would generally take 1 or 2 weeks.  Regards,

A Company (who has not agreed to go on record, but Smutny knows who it is) 
has decided not to build two planned power plants in CA because of all the 
uncertainty and the threat of the windfall profits tax.  Instead (and I'm not 
making this up), the Company is sending the two turbines to Bulgaria!

We discussed the idea of each file having its own card.  It was the consensus 
that this would be too much to track on a going forward basis due to all the 
name changes, mergers and the like.  I suggest we delay this project and 
assess how the new system works for awhile.  Then after we get caught up on 
other of the projects, we can reassess this idea.  Let me know what you 
think.  Mary

U.S. TRADING SUMMARY

Stocks continue to hover around unchanged levels as U.S. traders
await the Fed's decision on interest rates. Volatility and
trading volume diminished as the day wore on. While many traders
believe that the Fed will cut the key short-term interest rate an
aggressive 50 basis points, there is a sizable amount of
uncertainty surrounding the policy statement that will be
released with the Fed's rate decision. Given increasing
speculation that the Fed's easing cycle is coming to an end,
investors will closely scour the wording of the statement for
clues about future Fed actions. If the market interprets the Fed
as suggesting that its easing cycle is about to end, the stock
market's focus will likely shift back to corporate earnings,
which have been shaky of late and worrisome to investors.

----------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. TREASURY SUMMARY

All was quiet as bond traders await the outcome of the Federal
Open Market Committee's meeting at 2:15 p.m. EDT. Ahead of the
news, Treasuries drifted modestly lower on profit-taking as
shorter-dated Treasuries under-performed the bond. Reduced
expectations for continued Fed rate cuts have been the major drag
on shorter-term bills and notes this session. Look for Treasuries
to continue to trade in light volume ahead of the FOMC
announcement.

----------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENCY SUMMARY

With traders unwilling to make bets ahead of the FOMC meeting,
the dollar is little changed from morning levels against the euro
and the yen. The greenback is currently trading around 123.2 yen
and 0.879 dollars per euro.

----------------------------------------------------------------

MAJOR COMPANY / INDUSTRY NEWS
(All prices as of 1:05 p.m. EDT)

** Verisign (VRSN: 53.00, + 1.64) and the Department of Commerce
appear close to reaching an agreement that will extend Verisign's
control over the "".com"" Internet address suffix, according to The
Wall Street Journal. The agreement would be a major coup for
Verisign, which maintains control over the majority of Internet
domain name registrations. The company has come under the
microscope from regulators amid voiced concerns from other
companies stating that Verisign's hold over "".com"" is
anti-competitive. Currently, Verisign has a preliminary agreement
with the Department of Commerce to maintain control of the "".com""
suffix through at least 2007.

** Home Depot (HD: 50.11, + 0.96) reported a
stronger-than-anticipated profit in the first quarter of this
year, citing reduced expenses and stronger sales. The firm said
net income rose to $632 million, or $0.27 per share. Sales rose
9.8%. The firm was expected to earn $0.25 per share. As for the
next quarter, the firm said it expects to meet analysts'
expectations for per share profit.

** Bail has been set in the corporate espionage case involving
two former Lucent Technologies (LU: 9.80, + 0.09) employees who
are accused of stealing trade secrets. Authorities allege that
the information was destined for a company that is majority-owned
by the Chinese government. A federal judge set bail at $900,000
for each of the two defendants. The two former employees, along
with a third man, are accused of stealing source code and
software associated with Lucent's PathStar Access Server. The
case demonstrates the vulnerability of U.S. corporate companies
to the threat of global economic espionage.

** The time for individual stock futures is just around the
corner. Soon investors will be able to buy and sell futures on
individual stock issues on the largest U.S. derivatives
exchanges, according to newswire reports. Both the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange have
agreed to take part in the venture. The joint venture will be its
own regulated exchange and a for-profit entity. A future
obligates the holder to buy or sell the underlying security, at a
date and price that is specified in the future. Single-stock
futures trading may begin as early as August for institutional
investors and in December for retail investors.

----------------------------------------------------------------

RESEARCH SPOTLIGHTS

** Friedman, Billings and Ramsey upgraded shares of Tupperware
Corp. (TUP: 21.99, + 0.07) from an accumulate to a buy rating.

** Morgan Stanley upgraded shares of Robert Half International
(RHI: 28.34, + 0.42) from an outperform to a strong buy rating.

** Jefferies upgraded shares of 3DO Co. (THDO: 2.95, + 0.12) from
a hold to an accumulate rating.

Third Day in the Thirties

As traders filled out their ballots for the Friday/Saturday package, peak
power prices throughout the West shed a couple of dollars from Wednesday's
levels, but were said to remain in ""pretty strong"" territory.  While traders
primarily blamed the softer prices on the usual expectations of lower
weekend demand, others lamented that the stronger trend of late didn't coast
into a third day of trading.  ""It looks like the winter could be pretty
bullish if there are additional unexpected unit outages on the horizon,""
speculated one marketer.  Nonetheless, no traders expected a return to
100$/MWh territory anytime soon, with most reportedly sufficiently hedged to
meet load projections through the New Year.  Helping sustain the recent
strength was another strong day in the natural gas market, with NYMEX Henry
Hub front-month pieces gaining 3.7 cents on Thursday to close at
2.756$/mmBtu, while similar goods for February were seen 2.9 cents higher
than a day ago, closing at 2.822$/mmBtu.  In other news, a national
electricity deregulation bill set to go to Congress remained in committee
this week, due primarily to concerns over state rights.  Such a bill would
reportedly grant authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission above
current interstate powers, which has met opposition from both the 106th and
107th Congresses.

Heavy load energy costs in the Pacific Northwest fell by more than 2.5$/MWh
on lower weekend demand and weather forecasts calling for some milder
temperatures over the next several days.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia
traded between 30.25 to 33$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions taking place
around the 31.5$/MWh mark.  In unit news, Colstrip #4 (700 MW), down with a
tube leak since Tuesday, had its ETR extended until Friday.  Flow forecasts
for Chief Joseph were little changed, coming in at 90 kcfs Friday, 55 kcfs
Saturday, 50 kcfs Sunday, and 95 kcfs next Monday through Thursday.  Weather
forecasts called for temperatures to dip slightly over the weekend, while
the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting mostly above-normal
temperatures from December 19 to 23.

Despite spot natural gas prices remaining at Wednesday's robust levels and
slightly below-normal temperature forecasts for the weekend, peak power
prices in the Golden State declined a bit on Thursday.  Market players said
the day was busy, but couldn't pinpoint exactly why, with generation healthy
and other fundamentals accounted for.  Some hypothesized that with greater
scrutiny on the electricity market, some corporations were asking traders to
organize their books more thoroughly then usual at the end of this year.
Peak goods at NP15 changed hands between 32.5 and 37.25$/MWh, falling about
2 and 3$/MWH, respectively, off the high and low ends.  The off-peak product
saw action from 27.5 to 31$/MWh, within 50 cents of Wednesday deals at both
ends.  Natural gas prices at the Southern California border shaved just a
cent, trading between 2.59 and 2.64$/mmBtu.  SCE's CEO Stephen Frank
reportedly will retire effective January 1, 2002.  He postponed retirement
to steer the trouble utility through its bankruptcy reorganization.  In unit
news, California curtailments were fairly minor on Thursday.  Gas-fired unit
Crockett Cogen (260 MW), down since just Wednesday, returned to service on
Thursday.  Forecasts for Friday called for highs only in the 46 to 59 degree
range at most major load centers across the state, with overnight lows in
the 35 to 46 degree range.  Temperatures were expected to stay slightly
below normal through Monday, while the latest six-to-ten predicted normal
temperatures from December 19 to 23.

Amid cool temperatures and a sustained maintenance outage, peak power prices
nonetheless slumped in line with other prices in the West for the
Friday/Saturday combo in brisk Thursday trade.  Heavy load pieces at Palo
Verde changed hands between 32 and 36$/MWh, losing about 2$/MWh off both
ends of the price range.  In unit news, Four Corners #4 (750 MW) remained
off-line for condenser repairs, with an expected return of December 15.
Temperatures were expected to stay substantially below normal through
Sunday, with highs in the mid-50s and lows in the 30s.  Warming was
predicted for Monday, with the mercury expected to climb back into the
mid-60s.  The latest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from
December 19 to 23.

___________________________________________________________
Forecasts for colder weather in the new week were revised on Thursday to a
more normal outlook, causing day-ahead power prices to fall across the
Eastern Interconnect.  Traders said the next week product was still changing
hands at a premium on Thursday, but most thought it would take a tumble on
Friday as the market absorbs the new forecast.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas
futures headed higher on colder forecasts Thursday, but the upturn was
limited by the high storage levels.  January gained 3.7 cents to end at
2.756$/mmBtu, while February rose 2.9 cents to close at 2.822$/mmBtu.

As the prospects for winter weather and the corresponding strong demand it
brings remained dim on Thursday, heavy load electricity prices skidded lower
in the Mid-Atlantic.  Western PJM goods were bought and sold between 21.8
and 22.7$/MWh, down 30 cents to a day ago at both ends.  After a brief climb
to the lofty heights of 30$/MWh, LMPs settled back into the high-teens and
averaged 16.94$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Traders reported no new major
outages, and said trading was generally quiet on Thursday.  Forecasts for
Friday called for even warmer temperatures, with highs reaching the mid-60s
and lows in the also comfortable mid-50s.  Cooling was expected over the
weekend, and forecasts for the first day of the new week called for highs in
the 48 to 57 degree range.  The latest six-to-ten predicted below-normal
temperatures from December 19 to 23.

On mild temperatures and not much else, peak power prices softened in the
Midwest on Thursday.  Into Cinergy deals were done from 15.5 to 19$/MWh,
with most transactions completed in the 17s.  Trades for the front week
contract were heard around 22.55$/MWh.  In other Cinergy news, the
corporation sold $275 million in convertible 3 year bonds with a 9.5% yield
on Thursday, up $25 million from the original estimate of $250 million worth
of bonds.  On the unit front, nuke Dresden #3 (800 MW) remained down for
water leak repairs.  High temperatures for Friday were expected in the
mid-40s, with lows about 5 degrees lower in the 34 to 40 degree range.  The
five day outlook showed little change and the latest six-to-ten called for
below-normal temperatures from December 19 to 23.

Heavy load electricity prices weakened on Thursday in the Southeast,
depressed by continued warm temperatures and a healthy generation landscape.
Into Entergy goods changed hands between 18.5 and 20$/MWh, with the bulk of
deals done within a dime of 19$/MWh.  Into TVA trades were heard from 16.75
to 18.5$/MWh. In Washington, the fate of TVA's unfinished power plants was a
topic of the day, as members of Congress discussed whether TVA should be
allowed to lease the unfinished stations from its October $3.4 billion asset
reduction to private corporations for financing to complete them.  High
temperatures were expected uniformly in the 60s across the Southeast through
Monday.  The latest six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from
December 19 to 23.

Why do you say OK for weather?  What restrictions do you have for

hi tana

they're fine for non US & Canadian based products (including physical power) 
- the standard exceptions would be US power, weather and credit derivatives

Subject: Amerada-Hess Corporation

As an introduction:  The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out 
the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not 
all of the products it wants to trade).

When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved 
to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the 
European products, including specifically European physical power products 
(which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).

Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to 
check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the 
products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).

What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with 
respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap 
Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, 
which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone 
up for unless we really mean it.

So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian 
based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going 
to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down 
for European physical power.

Given recent events, we have decided to postpone the Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion scheduled for Tuesday, November 20.  

However, based on your interest, I will set up a conference call to discuss the outcomes of the climate change negotiations last week.  Broad rules for international greenhouse gas emissions trading and project-based programs under the Kyoto Protocol were adopted (Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation). 

If you would like to participate in the conference call on November 20, please RSVP to me via email.  For those in Houston, we can meet in EB 8C1.

A confirmation will be sent to participants by the end of the week.  Thanks for your interest.

Mark -

Francisco thinks that picking up Columbia would not be a big problem and that 
he can manage all of his Wholesale work while watching Columbia.  To my 
knowledge, Columbia should not present substantial work and would benefit 
from Francisco's watch.

I'm trying to keep Francisco working on EGA matters that he knows well and/or 
are less likely to ""balloon.""  Francisco has been willing to tackle a bit 
more than he currently has on his EGA plate, but he is also sensitive to 
making sure that he has sufficient time for all of his responsibilities.

Let me know if you have concerns.

Mark -

Given that South America legal resources are stretched thin, we will be 
checking with Francisco to see if he has time to pick up Columbia.  He knows 
it well and I don't believe that it will be particularly time-consuming for 
him.  But it would help free up Miguel Mendoza a bit for other South America 
matters.

I will expect Francisco to be cognizant of his other Wholesale obligations in 
saying ""yes"" or ""no.""

Subject: Exmar Purchase Decision


I just got off the phone with Jeff Skilling to make my pitch for doing the 
Exmar deal.  He said that he generally understands the logic of the deal but 
simply
wants the risk management discipine applied to analzing the position (a 
reiteration of what Rick Buy had said in our meeting today).  I would simply 
ask Vince's team to take a quick look tommorow at valuing the ships as stand 
alone positions with a guess at the volatility based on historical price 
movements.   This would
be much easier than the Rainbow option approach and would allow us to roughly 
look at the value of the options on the other two ships.  In other words we 
could look at two ship  long positions with some implied volatilities and 
also estimate daily VARs on the ships as if they were mark to market 
(although I agree with David that we will not likely be able to mark the 
ships because they will be treated as leases).

Subject: Exmar Purchase Decision


John,

After spending a few minutes with our shipping experts in the coal and oil 
groups, I have a slightly different angle on the Exmar LNG vessel decision.  
I would ideally like to spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do 
power and gas positions.  Unfortunately, we do not have that luxury and 
sometimes, in absence of true analytics, the most rudimentary measures can 
provide the best decision tools.  Here is how we would make the decision:

1)  Our shipping expert confirms that $140 million for a 135,000 ton ship 
represents a good price relative to new build costs over the last three years 
and that quotes have been trending up past that number recently.  He also 
confirms that the current trough is the result of the default of several Far 
East buyers and that new LNG orders and other ship building (cruise liners) 
have reduced the over capacity.  His experience and historic analysis has 
suggested that the pricing cycle for LNG ships lasts for a significant 
period.  New efficiency measures should reduce new build prices (and allow 
for a lower trough), but not by an extreme amount versus the $140 million 
cost of this vessel.   

Pierre normally likes to roll time charters; however, this is difficult in an 
illiquid shipping market like LNG.  He would purchase this ship if the LNG 
shipping book were his to manage.  He estimates the ship could be sold in a 
distressed sale for $110 million and could be potentially time chartered on a 
long term basis at a value of up to $200 million.  

2)  Our development teams in Spain, Italy and Turkey have been trying to 
solve the big question - gas.  In each country, the key to developing a 
merchant plant is securing gas flexibility or at least securing negotiating 
leverage with the monopoly gas supplier.  It is questionable whether or not 
this decision will have an immediate impact on Arcos.  The plant's time line 
and the realities of the LNG supply market may require that we commit to Gas 
Natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured.   The shear 
threat of being able to bring spot or term LNG to these markets will improve 
our negotiating leverage and/or allow us to create flexibility.  Going 
forward, however, other potential plant opportunities in Spain, and elsewhere 
in the Med region, may have the capacity to utilise these vessels.   I think 
that this flexibility is worth at least $25 million to me.

3)  I would summarise:   Upside   $60 + $25 = $85 million
     Downside           ($30) + $25 =             ($5)  million

I would do it.

I will leave the rest to you.

Joe

Subject: Pacific Virgo - Eric Tan's Statement

Matt,

Thanks for the heads-up; if you told me in the past that Eric was leaving, I 
had forgotten.  Eric is obviously a key witness in this case for us; I very 
much hope that he can be available to help us after he leaves and that he is 
indeed leaving in good graces.   Based on my recollection of my review of his 
statement, I don't have any problem if he has already signed it.  

If he hasn't signed it already, I would ask Eric to hold off a few more days 
and let David and Neale immediately consider whether the statement needs to 
be amended in any respect, so that this can be done before he signs it.  My 
feeling is that it is much better not to have more than one version of a 
signed witness statement.  I would also like to have David's thoughts on 
whether, under the circumstances, we should go forward with some sort of 
consulting agreement with Eric.  I am inclined to do it, if the business 
clients can shake loose the money, but do not want to if an English 
arbitrator would think that such an agreement does not pass the smell test.

As you know, Eric is scheduled to leave Enron at the end of the year. He will 
be clearing the remainder of his leave shortly. I have asked Chismar on 
several occasions whether an arrangement can be made to keep Eric as some 
sort of consultant, seeing that he would be a key witness if the matter goes 
to arbitration.  Chismar said he would discuss with Nowlan but has yet to 
reverted to me.

Although I believe Eric is leaving with good graces, seeing that there is 
some uncertainty about his availability as a witness, I have yesterday asked 
Eric to sign his statement. I also think it is advantageous for Eric to sign 
the statement whilst still an employee. I have reveiwed the statement and am 
comfortable with it. If there are to be subsequent changes, we can ask Eric 
to sign another.

I will circulate the signed statement to the team for reference.

Regards
Matt

Subject: Property Insurance Renewal 3/1/2001

Due to adverse loss experience the insurance market is ""hardening"" resulting 
in higher rates and more restrictive terms and conditions. Property insurance 
rates are generally rising for everyone and particularly those with poor loss 
experience. Unfortunately, Enron falls in the latter category. In the past, 
not withstanding our loss experience, Enron has enjoyed very competitive 
rates and a deductible of $500,000 for both property damage and business 
interruption (traditionally, property insurance policies contain a monetary 
deductible for property damage plus a day waiting period for business 
interruption (normally 30 to 90 days)).  For the period 1993 through 2000 
Enron paid premiums of approximately $114,100,000 and collected losses of 
approximately $ 212,200.000.  This trend is continuing under the current 
policy which is expiring on 3/1/2001. 

Current renewal terms being offered require an estimated premium of  
$17,000,000 and a deductible of $5,000,000 per loss for property damage and 
business interruption. This is the lowest deductible achievable unless we are 
willing to accept a waiting period for business interruption. 

Realising the potential costs and budgetary and contractual implications 
associated with such a change, we are continuing negotiations and seeking 
alternatives to the current renewal terms. However, we should all be prepared 
for an increase in premiums and the level of loss which we retain through 
deductibles. I will keep you advised as these negotiations progress. 

Please forward this notice to all concerned parties within your group. If 
there are any questions, please give me a call at ext. 36263.

COMPETITIVE LOCAL ENTRY
ARIZONA
Bill would end antitrust exemption for competitive services

The Arizona Legislature is considering a bill that would remove any
competitive telecom service from an exemption of the Uniform State
Antitrust Act.  Current law exempts any conduct or activity of a public
service corporation holding a certification of public convenience and
necessity from the Act.

The staff of the Democratic Caucus explained to TR that HB 2447 would
apply only to competitive services, not to the companies as a whole.
For example, the bill would affect services like Caller ID, call
waiting, and three-way calling.

The staff added that a similar bill that passed last year that removed
competitive electricity generation service from the antitrust exemption.

HB 2447, which was introduced by Rep. Bill Brotherton (D., District 20),
awaits consideration by the House Energy, Utilities, and Technology
Committee, the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee, and
the House Rules Committee.



ALTERNATIVE REGULATION
CONNECTICUT
DPUC nixes service reclassification, OKs rest of Verizon `alt reg' plan

The Department of Public Utility Control has approved Verizon New York,
Inc.'s revised proposed alternative regulation plan on the condition
that the company remove certain service reclassification provisions.

Connecticut law requires an incumbent local exchange carrier's (ILEC's)
services to be classified as competitive, noncompetitive, or
emerging-competitive.  Verizon had proposed that all new services and
new service packages offered during the plan would be ""proposed as
competitive, subject to the department's acceptance.""  Verizon also
suggested designating its toll service offerings as competitive because
the department already has classified such services as competitive for
the Southern New England Telephone Co. (SNET), the state's other ILEC.

The DPUC said the statute requires specific notice and hearing
procedures before it can change the classification of an ILEC's
service.  The department decided it couldn't roll the statutory
reclassification procedure into its tariff procedures.

Turning to the reclassification of toll services, the department said
that ""although Verizon's presence in Connecticut is dwarfed by SNET's
presence,"" Verizon is the incumbent telco in its two territories and
""arguably maintains the same presence as SNET when compared to
competitive local exchange companies.""  The DPUC concluded that Verizon
can't use its revised ""alt reg"" plan to ""circumvent"" the statutory
reclassification requirements.  It also concluded that Verizon hadn't
provided any evidence detailing the status and level of competition in
its territories.

The department found the rest of the plan acceptable, including the
elimination of the $2.07 touch tone charge for residential customers,
representing a $830,000 revenue reduction over the 3-year life of the
plan.  The revised plan also commits Verizon to previously established
service-quality requirements.

The department told Verizon to resubmit the plan, minus the service
reclassification provisions, by Feb. 15.  (Docket no. 99-03-06,
Application of the New York Telephone Co. for Alternative Regulation)



STATE & LOCAL GOVERNMENT
TEXAS
Counties would gain authority over wireless telecom facilities under
bill

Rep. Robert Cook (D., District 28) has introduced a bill that would give
counties authority to regulate wireless communications facilities,
including collocated or shared facilities.  HB 1148 would allow the
counties to require companies to seek permits for constructing,
expanding, or removing a tower or other facility.  The bill also would
authorize the counties to impose fees to cover the cost of regulating
the facilities.

The counties would be able to regulate the height, lighting, location,
and removal of the towers or other facilities.  HB 1148 additionally
establishes a set of procedures a person must complete before
constructing a wireless communications facility.



FUTURE OF REGULATION
TENNESSEE
Bill would limit utilities' charges for pole attachments

Sen. William C. Clabough (R., District 8) has introduced SB 1217 to
restrict the amount utilities could request or receive from telephone
companies or cable TV providers for attaching facilities to the
utilities' poles.  Utilities would have to comply with SB 1217 and other
applicable laws in granting permission for pole attachments.

The bill also would require utilities to offer access to their poles and
conduits located in public rights-of-way to any telephone company or
cable TV provider that requested such access.  Utilities could deny
requests for pole attachments only if access wasn't technically viable.
Telephone companies and cable TV providers that were refused permission
to attach facilities to a utility's poles could file a lawsuit for a
declaratory judgment or injunction, or both.

The bill's text is available at
http://www.legislature.state.tn.us/bills/currentga/BILL/SB1217.pdf.



INTERNET
NORTH DAKOTA
Legislators fight extension of Internet tax moratorium

A resolution introduced in the House would urge the U.S. Congress to
reject any attempt to extend the Internet Tax Freedom Act's moratorium
on state and local taxes on Internet access and electronic commerce
transactions.  The moratorium expires Oct. 21.

Reps. Francis Wald (R., District 37), George Keiser (R., District 47),
and Mike Timm (R., District 5) and Sens. Judy Lee (R., District 13), Tim
Mathern (D., District 11), and Herb Urlacher (R., District 36)
introduced HCR 3012.



INTERNET
OREGON
House OKs digital signature bill

The House has approved a bill to require the Department of
Administrative Services to adopt rules for the use of digital signature
by state agencies.  HB 2040 would require the adoption of rules to
ensure adequate integrity, security, and confidentiality of state agency
e-commerce transactions.  The rules also would need to ensure that
transactions could be audited.

The Joint Legislative Committee on Information Management and Technology
requested the introduction of HB 2040 on behalf of the Oregon Internet
Commission.



NETWORK MANAGEMENT
MICHIGAN
Local calling areas to become larger for Ameritech, Verizon customers

The Public Service Commission yesterday determined that local calling
area should be defined as the ""home exchange to which a customer's local
access line is assigned as specified in the maps and boundary
descriptions of the incumbent local telephone service provider's
tariffs.""

The commission adopted the definition pursuant to a provision of a
recent amendment to the Michigan Telecommunications Act.  (7/7/00 p.m.)
The provision requires calls made to calling areas adjacent to the
caller's local calling area to be considered and billed as local calls.

The PSC determined that the statutory provision doesn't create a new
service and thus prohibits setting a rate for expanded local calling as
a new service.  Carriers must charge the same rate that they have been
charging for local calls.  They may make adjustments in customers'
access areas (and thus the associated access charges) or rate groups for
basic local exchange service.

The commission's order is available at
http://cis.state.mi.us/cgi-bin/mpsc/vieworder.cgi?filename=/mpsc/orders/comm/2
001/u-12515b.htm.
(Case nos. U-12515, U-12528)



CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
KENTUCKY
PSC plans meeting to discuss `N11' pricing issues

The Public Service Commission has scheduled a Feb. 13 conference with
Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co. and the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet to
discuss pricing issues related to ""N11"" abbreviated dialing codes.
Specifically, the PSC intends to address the proposed contract between
Cincinnati Bell and the Transportation Cabinet for converting access to
travel and information services from the ""211"" code to ""511"" code.  In
addition, Cincinnati Bell will be expected to defend its proposed price
for providing 511 service to the cabinet.

In November 1997 the PSC required Cincinnati Bell to allocate the 211
dialing code to the cabinet for a trial period.  Then, in July 2000 the
FCC ruled that the 511 dialing code should be used for travel
information.  Last fall the PSC assigned the 511 dialing code in
Cincinnati Bell's service area to the state's transportation cabinet to
serve as a travel and safety information service.  (11/1/00 a.m.)

In January the PSC reopened its investigation into the allocation of N11
dialing codes in response to BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.'s Dec.
11, 2000, filing of tariffs to provide 511, 211, and ""711"" services.
(1/16/01 a.m.)

(Administrative case no. 343 - In the Matter of Investigation into the
Assignment of Abbreviated N11 Dialing Codes)



CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
ILLINOIS
Rep. Franks takes aim at telemarketers

Rep. Jack D. Franks (D., Woodstock) has introduced HB 570 to require
telemarketers to register with the attorney general, obtain a surety
bond, and maintain certain business records.  The measure would require
the AG to charge ""reasonable"" application and renewal fees.

Telemarketers would have to disclose their identity, purpose for
calling, and the nature of the goods or services being offered during a
telephone solicitation.  They would have to provide written notice to
customers 10 days after completing a sale.

The AG would have the authority to enforce any provisions of the
legislation as an unawful act under the state's Consumer Fraud and
Deceptive Business Practices Act.



INTERNET
MISSISSIPPI
Internet child protection bills advance

Two bills that aim to protect children from sexual exploitation over the
Internet have passed their first hurdles in the Legislature.  HB 1140,
introduced by Rep. Jamie Franks Jr. (D., District 19), has passed the
House.  The bill would ban the use of the Internet to transport visual
depictions of children engaging in sexually explicit acts.  (1/22/01
a.m.)

SB 2146, sponsored by Sen. Terry C. Burton (D., District 31), has
cleared the Senate.  The bill would prohibit using the Internet to
distribute ""indecent materials"" with the intent of seducing a minor.
(1/23/01 a.m.)



NETWORK MANAGEMENT
ARIZONA
Bill would change excise tax that funds emergency telecom services

Sen. Susan Gerard (R., District 18) has introduced a bill that would
alter the tax levied to fund the state emergency telecom services fund.
SB 1504 would levy a tax of 37.5 cents per month for each activated
wireline and wireless service account.

Under current law, the tax on wireline carriers is a percentage of their
gross proceeds, and wireless carriers are assessed a flat tax.  SB 1504
awaits consideration by the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate
Rules Committee.

John,

Sorry for the confusion.
This is a second  tanker on which very few details
are available . The LNG group is working as we speak
to provide some information for Joe Sutton before
his departure for Paris this (Tuesday) afternoon.
There is no DASH on this 2nd tanker yet. I asked Dave Gorte
on Monday to send me one and was not told that
he can provide me with the Mystic Lady DASH as  the closest
substitute.

Vince - thanks for the update.  What I am not sure of is what if any decision 
has to be
made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals 
have already
been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or 
two.

Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision  

John,

This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.

1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH 
and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the 
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island 
project (please, see point 2).

2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest 
(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island 
transaction. The next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is 
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.

A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:

a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island 
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term
contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.

The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the 
long-term
contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are 
setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal 
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and 
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.

b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension 
option of
5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we
have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for 
such a long tenor. This is  
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread 
and
I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.

One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the 
first
5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.

c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a 
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market.

d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island 
deal
(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.
Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail 
that 
correlates very well with Brent.

Vince

I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  
Anyway with Greg moving to his
new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the 
Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.

I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for 
LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand
that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far 
away).  Anway I understand this
is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you 
please let me know where you stand now?

I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in 
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.

Look forward to connecting with you Vince.

John

Rick, I disagree - the DASH had an implication unsubstantiated that the 
current deal on the table is a bad one.  I believe that RAC should provide a 
clear opinion or say directly that the analysis is deficient.

It is too easy to state the obvious.

Delainey

In my opion this DASH did exactly what it was supposed to do - prompt a 
dialog on whether we are getting an adequate price for this asset. My 
understanding is that no model was built to value an alternative nor was 
there any effort to market the company. If we want to ""take the money and 
run"" (whhich in this case is probably the right decision) fine, but we should 
know what we are leaving behind, especially given the current commodity price 
environment.  Rick

gerald,

i have a couple of questions for you:

1)  susan scott told me that she would get back to you with some of the nits 
that she had on the hubbard document.  i am waiting for the final comments 
from dushinske, but they should come today.  i would like to get everything 
signed today because we want to make sure that we can book the gas at these 
high prices.

2)  vector term sheet.  i seem to have deleted my copy of the most recent 
draft we had circulating.  can you send me your most recent update, please?

if i hear anything from dushinske, i will let you know,

thanks,

jamie"

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Subject: for Rosalee - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial


Rosalee -- I just wanted to follow up to see if there are any further
questions you (or Mr Lay) have had with regard to the OECD FORUM and IEA
Ministerial sessions scheduled for 15-16 May here in Paris.  The schedule is
as I sent it to you in April -- although there may be some changes with the
events at the Ministerial dinner.  Here, while we are still intending that
Mr. Lay provide a summary of the FORUM session to the ministerial
participants, we may need to re-order the dinner agenda slightly to
accommodate Secretary Abraham's schedule.  We will keep you posted.

I would also appreciate receiving a copy of the CV that you sent to the OECD
for our own files; we are trying to compile a full set of all participants
for use during the sessions.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Pershing

My contact at Nicor, Mary Hill, says their trader confirmed with you that the price on deal #664380 should be GDD.  Sitara has GDP.  The price that was agreed to between you and the Nicor trader, according to Nicor, was $5.33 on the 10-12, according to our records, we are billing $5.34.  I need your help in correcting this matter.

This is a new interconnect into the suction side of WT-1.  I think the capacity is going to be approximately
50,000 mmbtu.  This may be able to flow sometime this or next.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Constellation Energy Group Underway on
680MW Power Plant in Florida, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 19, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.; Houston).
Constellation Energy Group (NYSE:CEG) (Baltimore) is currently
underway on construction of a $250 million 680 mega-watt (MW) natural
gas-fired power plant in central Florida.
	   The Oleander Power Plant, located on a 37-acre site in Brevard
County near the City of Cocoa off I-95 and State Road 520, is
scheduled to be in commercial operation by May of 2002. It will
provide enough power to serve the electric needs of nearly 250,000
homes.
	   Lockwood Greene (Spartanburg, S.C.) has been selected to provide
engineering services and the construction division, J. A. Jones
Construction (Charlotte, N.C.), will construct the plant. Both
companies are part of Jones Incorporated.
	   The simple-cycle plant will consist of five units utilizing
General Electric 7FA combustion turbines. A seven-year power sales
agreement has also been reached with Seminole Electric Cooperative
(Tampa, Fla.) to purchase a portion of the plant's electrical output.
The remainder of the power will be sold on the wholesale power market
to help meet the growing energy demand in Florida.
	   Constellation Energy Group is an integrated energy company, which
includes Constellation Power Source, Baltimore Gas and Electric, the
oldest utility in the country, and Constellation Nuclear. Formed in
1997, Constellation Power Source is a national merchant energy company
that meets the energy requirements of wholesale customers such as
electric co-operatives, power marketers, municipalities, and
utilities.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting."

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The results of an internal investigation into Enron
Corp.'s (ENRNQ) collapse may be released early next week, a company lawyer said
Wednesday. 
  The report will be posted online, at the Web site of the  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court of the Southern District of New York.
The report is the culmination of Enron's three-month effort to account for
off-balance sheet partnerships that the company used to keep debt off its books
and to maintain a healthy credit rating. 
  The transactions led the company last November to write down $1.2 billion of
shareholder equity and to restate four years worth of earnings. 
  Enron formed the special task force in October, hoping to restore investors'
confidence in an energy-trading company that had begun to falter. 
  The committee is made up of outside directors led by William Powers Jr., dean
of the University of Texas law school. William McLucas - former head of the
Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division and a partner at the
Washington, D.C., law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering - represents the task force.
  McLucas didn't return phone calls seeking comment, and Powers couldn't
immediately be reached for comment.
The committee served as a liaison between Enron and the SEC, which launched
its own investigation into the company's  accounting practices last year. 
  Deloitte & Touche serves as the task force's independent  accountant. 
  The results of the investigation are expected to shed more light into the
complex books of a company that had more  than 3,500 units and numerous
off-balance sheet partnerships. 
  Edward Ketz, an associate professor of accounting at Penn State's Smeal
College of Business, said that it's unlikely that more significant surprises
will come out of the report. 
  But, he said, ""if there's any further bombshell, the real damage will be done
with the accounting profession itself. It may give greater weight for Congress
to do something (about accounting guidelines).""
News of the internal report's release came during a hearing before Judge
Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New
York. 
  Wednesday, Gonzalez approved the retention of two law firms, Weil Gotshal &
Manges and Togut Segal & Segal, as attorneys for the debtor. 
  In doing so, the judge overruled an objection by Enron creditor Wiser Oil Co.
(WZR), which is owed about $7 million  in trade debt, asking that a separate
legal team be appointed for Enron's core unit, Enron North America. This
subsidiary includes the wholesale energy-trading operations,  which generated
90% of the company's $101 billion in revenue last year. 
  Gonzalez noted that the creditor's concerns - one being that funds from the
Enron North America unit will be used to  benefit other subsidiaries - are
likely to be addressed in the next month, at court hearings to consider motions
for a trustee, examiner and a new cash-management system. 
  The bankruptcy court, earlier this week, approved Milbank Tweed as the law
firm for Enron's official creditors  committee, after no objections were filed.
Also Wednesday, Judge Gonzalez disclosed that his wife is part of a New York
City pension fund involved in Houston litigation against Enron. But he said
this doesn't disqualify him from presiding over the Enron case. 
  ""The court has examined and does not believe that my partiality will be
compromised,"" said Gonzalez. 
  When New York City pension matters are brought before the court, Gonzalez
will ""take steps"" to ensure that no conflicts of interest exist, he said. 
  The New York City pension funds along with the Florida State Board of
Administration have asked the bankruptcy court to enter a detailed order
requiring Enron to preserve its books and records. The hearing is set for Feb.
5. 
  The city and state pension funds are seeking the role of  co-lead plaintiffs
in class-action lawsuits filed against Enron in Texas, claiming securities
violations and fraud by company executives. 
  In total, the New York City pension funds claim a loss of $109 million from
Enron-related investments, while the Florida State Board claims losses of $334
million. 
  The New York City pension funds made up about 20% of his  wife's retirement
fund, said Gonzalez.

Ex-Enron Workers Plead With Congress For Financial Help

01/30/2002

WASHINGTON (AP)--Laid-off Enron (ENRNQ) workers pressed for help Wednesday on Capitol Hill, putting faces to some of the stories of retirement nest eggs lost when the company collapsed. 
Organized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, several dozen workers piled in buses to make the 25-hour trip from Houston to appeal for help paying for mortgages, health care, groceries, children's tuition and other living expenses.
""I lost everything, because I believed in Enron,"" Jessie Patterson told House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo, and other Democratic lawmakers. Earlier, the workers met with AFL-CIO officials. 
Gephardt pledged Democrats' help to assuage ""this ... tragedy of great proportions."" 
He said Enron's implosion, the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, should spur changes in laws governing pension and 401(k) plans that would give people more control over investments and greater protection against corporate mismanagement. 
Enron's generous political donations and attempts to influence energy policy also should also spark congressional passage of long-stalled legislation aimed at reducing the influence of big money in politics, Gephardt said. 
""I believe with all my heart that we have to clean up politics in this country,"" he said. 
Gwen Gray, who worked in Enron human resources, said she processed millions of dollars in bonuses that were paid to retain key executives in the two months leading up to the bankruptcy, while workers were given 30 minutes to get out of the building without severance pay. 
Almost 95% of Gray's 401(k) was invested in company stock. She said she has $109 left, ""and that will pay my light bill that's due Monday."" 
Several workers said they were having difficulty finding work because companies in the Houston area have been reluctant to hire Enron workers. Many feared that speaking out would hurt job prospects or target them for retaliation. 
""We're not here just for a handout,"" said Kathy Benedict, who can't afford the $300 a month to extend her health insurance benefits. ""We need jobs."" 
Several workers said lawmakers should change federal bankruptcy laws to make workers and their retirement plans secured creditors that would be at the top of the list for available assets. Workers now come after secured creditors. 
""Maybe it's too late for us, but there are other people out there,"" said Dennis Vegas. ""This could happen to other Americans.""

Former Enron Employee Warned Lay of Energy Contract Losses
2002-01-30 16:00 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- A former Enron Corp. manager warned then-Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in August that the company was hiding at least $500 million in losses on energy contracts, adding to evidence that senior executives knew about the company's growing debt, U.S. lawmakers said.
     Enron Energy Services, the unit that advised businesses and property owners on energy use and operated heating, lighting and air conditioning equipment on their behalf, ""had been doing deals for two years and was losing money on almost all the deals they booked,'' Margaret Ceconi, a former EES manager, wrote to Lay in an Aug. 29 e-mail. ""They are trying to cover up their dumb decisions.''
     Representatives Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House commerce committee, and John Dingell, the panel's senior Democrat, included a copy of the e-mail in a letter to Lay asking him whether he responded to Ceconi and or discussed her allegations with Enron's accounting and legal departments.
     The commerce committee is one of 10 congressional panels investigating Enron's collapse. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission also are looking into what led Enron, whose stock rose as high as $82 a share last year, to file the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2. Lawmakers have predicted that changes in the law and criminal indictments would result from the probes.
     Ceconi's e-mail echoed one sent by Sherron Watkins, an Enron vice president, in mid-August to Lay. In that note, Watkins said that said former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling had ignored warnings from other company executives about conflicts of interest in partnerships the company created to hide the size of its debt.
     ""One can only surmise that the removal of Jeff Skilling was an action taken by the board to correct the wrong doings of the various management teams at Enron,'' Ceconi wrote.
     Skilling quit Enron last August and Lay returned to the job. Lay resigned last week as chief executive.
     One area investigators are looking into is whether executives of Enron, once the largest energy trader, misled shareholders and employees before it restated earnings in November.

Former Enron Employee Told Lay Earnings Misrepresented
By Bryan Lee

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Kenneth Lay, the former chairman and chief executive at Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), received at least two warnings last August that questionable - and potentially illegal - accounting practices would become the company's financial undoing.
Both memos warned that skepticism and increasing scrutiny in the wake of the surprise resignation that month of Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling would bring the company's financial plight to light. 
The first, now widely reported, came from Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, and discussed the various off-the-books transactions the company had engaged in, which ultimately contributed to the company's financial undoing later in the year. 
""I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"" Watkins wrote prophetically. 
Now congressional investigators have released another memo, sent to Lay on Aug. 29 via e-mail, from a recently laid-off employee who worked in sales for nine months at Enron Energy Services. 
Margaret Ceconi, who had been recruited from GE Capital (GE), asked her e-mail be forwarded to Enron's board, warning, ""The house of cards (is) falling."" 
Democratic staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee released the e-mail Wednesday, with Lay being scheduled to testify Monday before both the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee. 
Ceconi's e-mail goes into some detail about huge losses stemming from a number of retail electricity deals with commercial customers, and complains she was ""fraudulently"" recruited to the company. 
The e-mail ticks off a number of money-losing deals, and warns of potential Securities and Exchange Commission violations for ""knowingly misrepresent(ing) EES's earnings"" by hiding the losses in Enron's profitable wholesale electricity business. 
Ceconi warned the losses would add up to more than $500 million. ""Rumor on the 7th floor is that it is closer to $1 billion,"" she wrote. 
""But somehow EES, to everyone's amazement, reported earnings for the 2nd quarter,"" she continued, warning of accounting standards violations. 
That EES misrepresented its earnings ""is common knowledge among all the EES employees, and is actually joked about. But it should be taken seriously,"" Ceconi warned, citing industry analysts who ""know what's going on, they just can't confirm it. YET.""

Ex-Enron Employees Ask Democrats for Secured Creditor Status
2002-01-30 16:33 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp. employees today asked lawmakers to give them the same status as secured creditors in the company's bankruptcy and a bailout like the one the ailing airline industry received after Sept. 11.
     ""If I was a flood victim, the Red Cross would have been at my door the next morning,'' said Deborah Johnson, an ex-employee. ""We want relief.''
     About a dozen former Enron staffers from Houston went to the Capitol to meet with House Democrats today on a trip sponsored by the AFL-CIO federation of labor unions and the Reverend Jesse Jackson, chairman of the Rainbow-PUSH Coalition.
     The fired employees said they were frustrated that retention bonuses were granted to executives days before Enron filed for bankruptcy, while they can't cash their $4,500 severance checks because that money is tied up in bankruptcy court.
     ``They got bounced $4,500 checks and executives get a sound $100 million check the day before,'' Jackson said.
     As unsecured creditors, many Enron employees will receive money they're owed by the company only after secured creditors are paid.
     Shareholders are suing Enron, once the world's No. 1 energy trader, claiming that the company and its accountants hid some $600 million in losses from investors, triggering the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history.
     Representative Shelia Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Houston, called for hearings to examine bankruptcy laws during an informal meeting with the employees.
     ""The bankruptcy court closed the door on your severance,'' said Jackson Lee, adding that House hearings would look into ways Enron could be forced to set aside money for employees before it continues its restructuring.

Not Forthcoming

     The employees also asked for legislation to give them the same status as secured creditors in the bankruptcy case and said they're seeking the same sort of bailout that lawmakers gave the ailing airline industry following Sept. 11.
     Many of the employees blamed Enron executives for not being forthcoming about the company's financial situation.
     ""I've lost my job, I've lost the money I contributed to the 401k plan, and I had stock options I did not exercise,'' because company officials predicted the stock value would rise, said Monique VanVooren-Shankel, a former Enron employee. ""It evaporated.''
     A handful of Texas Democrats at a press conference with House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and the fired workers vowed to push legislation that would give employees higher status in bankruptcy cases.
     ""The current bankruptcy code doesn't provide secured creditor status for 401k participants, and that needs to change,'' said Representative Ken Bentsen. Bentsen's bill would place 401k plan participants at the top of the list of unsecured creditors in the event of a bankruptcy where the plan fiduciary misled investors.
     Bentsen and Jackson Lee, along with 43 percent of the rest of the House, received contributions from Enron.

USA: New Enron president no stranger to corporate storms.
By Dan Wilchins

01/30/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Jeff McMahon, promoted Tuesday to president and chief operating officer at scandal-wracked Enron Corp. , has a knack for finding himself in the middle of corporate maelstroms. 
His ability to deal with trouble in a straight-shooting style was likely attractive to a company desperately needing some truth serum.
McMahon is said to have openly questioned some of the major off-balance sheet partnerships set up by Enron that contributed to the energy giant filing the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in December. 
As a company insider, he understands the inner workings of Enron's complex dealings. That asset could help Enron in its survival strategy. But it could also prove to be a liability, if inquiries about off-balance sheet structures raise concerns about McMahon's involvement. 
The boyish-faced McMahon, a trained accountant known for his political savvy and strong sales ability, has held a number of senior roles at Enron, including executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp., and president and chief executive officer of Enron Industrial Markets. 
Enron isn't the first place in which McMahon, 41, has found himself at the center of a major corporate controversy. 
A decade ago, he was a young internal auditor caught up in a case that gained almost as much notoriety as Enron, as trading losses at his former employer, the U.S. subsidiary of German industrial giant Metallgesellschaft AG, nearly bankrupted the parent company. 
A HEDGE GONE AWRY 
In the early 1990s, McMahon was an internal auditor at the U.S. unit of Metallgesellschaft, MG Corp., which eventually lost more than $1 billion from oil futures trading, making headlines throughout the world. 
He wrote a series of internal audit reports critical of risk management and accounting procedures at the MG Corp. subsidiary responsible for the losses, MG Refining and Marketing, Inc. (MGR&M). 
""(McMahon) was one of the heroes at MG Corp.,"" said Bob Bernstein, a lawyer at Kaye Scholer LLP in New York, who represents Metallgesellschaft, now known as mg Technologies . 
Figuring out exactly what went wrong at MG Corp. is a cottage industry. The case is studied in business schools, and many former employees of the company and some academics insist that in the long-term, the MG trading strategy would have made money. 
MG Corp. was caught out in a trading strategy that amounted to a huge bet on oil futures prices. When oil prices dropped in 1993, the futures positions hemorrhaged cash, threatening the collapse of the entire company. 
""They were involved in giant speculation,"" said Jeff Parsons, an economist at Charles River Associates in Boston, who has studied MG Corp. The oil futures were meant to hedge longer-term supply contracts, but also provide a source of profit. 
RAISING RED FLAGS 
Internal audit reports obtained by Reuters indicate that McMahon's audit team was sounding alarms even before MG Corp. began hemorrhaging cash, and continued to do so as the problems persisted. 
An audit of risk management procedures at MGR&M dated August 27, 1993, found that risk management ""require(d) improvement,"" The amount of risk capital committed to the trading was ""much larger than anticipated in the original business plan,"" according to the report. 
Although the internal audit team was told that the Board of Directors had approved changes to the business plan, there was no formal written approval of the changes, the report continued. 
""The lack of formal approval presents the risk that deviations from the approved plan occur, go undetected, and expose the Company to financial loss,"" McMahon's report said. 
Management at the time ignored him, but after the losses were sustained, new management was brought in, saw McMahon's reports, considered additional evidence, and fired the architects of the strategy, Kaye Scholer's Bernstein said. 
MG managed through the crisis and continued to operate, though with significant help from bankers in a major bailout operation. 
A SIMILAR ROLE 
At Enron, McMahon may have played a role similar to that at MG Corp. 
According to a letter sent from Sherron Watkins, a vice president at Enron, to former Chairman Kenneth Lay, which was written after Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling resigned in August, McMahon was highly concerned about the off-balance sheet LJM partnerships, a series of deals set up by Enron. 
McMahon, then Enron's treasurer, demanded that five issues regarding LJM be addressed, if he was to remain in that position, Watkins said. Three days later, Skilling offered him the chief executive officer spot at Enron Industrial Markets, the letter said. 
For his part, Skilling has said that McMahon did raise concerns - but his primary issue was the impact of LJM on his compensation, according to Judy Leon, a spokeswoman for Skilling in Washington, D.C. 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET DEALS MAY PROVE NETTLESOME 
McMahon reports to Stephen Cooper, who on Tuesday was named acting chief executive. 
This joins Cooper, an outsider with a restructuring background, with McMahon, an insider not implicated directly in any wrongdoing. Still, McMahon was a senior financial official while a series of off-balance-sheet transactions were structured, and many of them had cross investments in one another, a banker who knows McMahon said. 
McMahon has so far successfully avoided criticism for his involvement with off-balance sheet structures, the banker said. ""But who knows if he'll get dragged into this?,"" he added.

Enron Energy Services To Surrender Illinois License
By Jon Kamp

01/30/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Energy Services is voluntarily giving up its certificate to serve commercial and industrial customers in Illinois, once a key growth area for the Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) unit, a spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday.
The Illinois Commerce Commission decided Tuesday to revoke the retail electric provider certificate held by Enron Energy Services, because its parent's debt rating is below investment grade. Though EES could fight the order, it doesn't plan to, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. 
""It became clear that we weren't going to be able to keep our license because of the debt rating,"" she said. 
EES is now facing similar issues in other states, including Texas and California, where it has a particularly large presence, Mahoney said. While it is fighting to keep customers in other areas, the clear financial benchmarks required for suppliers in Illinois leave EES with few options, she said. 
Mahoney was unable to list the number of customers EES had in Illinois, but the company was establishing a strong foothold in Chicago before it joined Enron in bankruptcy court in December. EES signed its first Chicago-area energy management deal with the Archdiocese of Chicago in 1998, then added other high-profile customers like the City of Chicago and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) unit Quaker Oats Co., among many others. 
EES had aggressive growth plans in the region. In an early October interview, before Enron's troubles became widely known, EES Chief Operating Officer Jeremy Blachman said Enron planned to build its share of the Chicago energy sales market to 8% to 10% from less than 1%. Chicago accounts for the lion's share of the $6 billion to $8 billion Illinois market. 
Now, the company is quietly moving in the opposite direction, trimming its profile in Illinois. The City of Chicago, Quaker and the Archdiocese have all recently walked away from their contracts with EES. In early January, a New York bankruptcy judge approved Enron's request to terminate many other Chicago-area deals, Mahoney said. 
Nationwide, EES received the power it needed to fulfill contracts from Enron's wholesale unit. Once Enron all but ceased power trading, EES was left to scramble for power from other suppliers. To date, it has managed to keep most of its 32,000 contracts while it tries to figure out how to restructure and maintain service, Mahoney said. 
But EES wasn't actually supplying Illinois customers with power. Instead, it was serving primarily as a billing agent, helping its Illinois clients manage their power needs, Mahoney said. It's still unclear whether EES needs its state certificate to serve as a billing agent, ICC Commissioner Ruth Kretschmer said Tuesday. 
Regardless, the company may not want to continue those operations, Mahoney said. EES was waiting for Illinois' young competitive retail market to mature before it signed actual deals to supply energy, using its billing-agent business to get its foot in the door. 
""We were in the process of putting in place the ability for us to supply physically,"" Mahoney said. ""We had thought that was imminent."" 
Now, Enron must decide whether it is still worth maintaining billing-agent and energy-management deals in Illinois when there is no possibility they will evolve into energy-supply contracts, Mahoney said. EES could also apply for a new supplier certificate in the future. 
""That's exactly what we're reviewing right now,"" Mahoney said. ""It's unclear what we will ultimately do in Illinois.""

USA: UPDATE 1-Probe needed into Enron's California deals-FERC.
By Chris Baltimore

01/30/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said Wednesday that the agency should investigate whether bankrupt Enron Corp. manipulated wholesale electricity prices in California. 
Enron, accused by Western politicians of raising prices in long-term supply contracts following California's power crisis, has denied any wrongdoing.
""We need to clear up that lingering doubt,"" said FERC commissioner Nora Brownell, a Republican appointee to the agency last summer. ""If there was market manipulation, we need to find it and we need to deal with it."" 
Brownell, speaking to reporters after a routine FERC meeting, made her comments after FERC Chairman Pat Wood testified on Tuesday before the Senate Energy Committee about Enron's impact on U.S. energy markets. Wood indicated during the hearing a willingness to open an agency investigation of Enron at the request of West Coast politicians. 
Enron supported Brownell's appointment to FERC because she was a free market advocate while a member of the Pennsylvania public utilities commission. 
The Houston-based company was among several independent power producers that enjoyed big increases in revenues early last year after Western spot market prices for wholesale power soared tenfold, to as high as $400 per megawatt hour. 
The electricity crisis was linked to California's failed deregulation scheme that did not encourage new plant construction and barred the state's utilities from passing through higher wholesale prices to consumers. 
The state eventually signed long-term supply contracts for some $42 billion worth of wholesale power supplies during coming years. Those contracts have been criticized by activist groups and some politicians as locking in prices well above market levels. 
ALLEGED OVERCHARGES 
Still pending before a FERC administrative judge is California's demand for some $9 billion in alleged overcharges by Enron and a dozen other wholesale suppliers. That case is unlikely to be determined for several more months. 
Brownell was noncommittal on what action FERC should take if any market manipulation was found to have occurred with Enron's sales into California. 
""I think there are tools we have to deal with the conclusion that someone manipulated the market,"" Brownell said. So far, there is no price data to show Enron did anything wrong, she said. 
""We need to get to the underlying facts of the case,"" she added. 
FERC has not officially opened an investigation yet but is expecting a formal request from Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Maria Cantwell of Washington, an agency spokesman said. 
Enron is accused of raising electricity prices in long-term supply contracts negotiated with the state of California following its power crisis. 
Data presented at the Senate panel's Tuesday hearing by an independent power market analyst showed West Coast forward prices for wholesale power plunged by 30 percent on Dec. 3, the day after Enron declared the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
Some Western senators said the data indicated Enron had inflated power prices before its bankruptcy. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said he wanted to ""lift the veil of secrecy"" around Enron's wholesale power transactions in the West.

GAO to Sue White House for Energy Task Force Records

Wednesday, January 30, 2002
FOX News
WASHINGTON - In an unprecedented move, the General Accounting Office will sue the White House for access to Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force records, Fox News has learned.
Unless the ""GAO gets the information they want or is in good faith negotiations, we're headed for court"" a GAO official told Fox News on Wednesday.
The official said that in recent GAO discussions with congressional investigators, it has been ""clear the White House is telling their side of the story, significantly misrepresenting certain facts""
GAO officials were calling congressional leaders at the Capitol Wednesday morning to tell them of the decision. An official announcement explaining the GAO's reasoning was expected after noon. 
It will be the first time in the GAO's 80-year existence that it has sued the executive branch. The process of filing the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington is expected to take two to four weeks. 
A decision had been expected from GAO Comptroller General David Walker, leader of Congress's investigative arm, all week. The GAO wants to force Cheney, who ran the task force, to turn over documents on the meetings held last year with business executives as the Bush administration crafted a new national energy policy. 
Some of the meetings included officials from the now-collapsed Enron Corp., a Houston-based energy broker with deep ties to Bush. 
Although lawyers for the White House and the agency had continued talks this week, Cheney said on Sunday that the dispute ""probably will get resolved in court."" 
In resisting the GAO, Cheney insists that providing the list of industry executives would harm his ability to receive advice in the future, and that the congressional investigators are overstepping their bounds. The GAO, as a congressional agency, insists it has the authority to request the information. 
Any GAO lawsuit would be highly controversial on Capitol Hill. The agency's investigation began after Democrats on April 19 requested that the GAO investigate the conduct, operations and funding of the Cheney energy task force. 
On Tuesday, some Republicans had threatened to try to block the suit. 
""I think it may come to that,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
Congress' investigative arm shouldn't be ""trying to impose disclosure on internal White House meetings to determine policy,"" Hatch said. ""If you have to do that, pretty soon there wouldn't be any meetings."" 
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said he and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., planned to ""talk to the agency."" 
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he was researching to see whether the GAO would be overstepping its authority by taking on the administration. 
""My concerns are that it would encroach upon the deliberative process and make it impossible for the vice president at the direction of the president to make a recommendation,"" Specter said. ""It's also a tricky area on executive privilege."" 
The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that then-Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay gave Cheney a three-page document last April detailing the energy trading company's arguments against price caps or other measures to stabilize electricity prices in California. 
""Events in California and in other parts of the country demonstrated that the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not reached consumers,"" the memo said. 
The newspaper said some of the positions included in the memo were included in Cheney's energy plan. 
An Enron spokesman told the newspaper that Lay gave the memo to Cheney. Mary Matalin, an adviser to Cheney, said the energy plan included input from many sources. 
On Tuesday, an energy consultant suggested to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that Enron may have been using largely secret trades to manipulate energy markets. 
Robert McCullough, a consultant whose clients include several Northwest utilities, testified that in the week after Enron announced its bankruptcy, the ""forward price"" of electricity in the West fell sharply. Enron had been a key trader in this market, which is used as a hedge against future power price changes and is unregulated. 
""That certainly raises the question about whether Enron was manipulating the West Coast market"" by keeping prices artificially high, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in response to the consultant's testimony. 
McCullough said ""the clear implication is that Enron may have been using its market dominance to set forward prices."" 
Other energy experts said other reasons may have been behind the price decline. Lawrence Makovich, a power industry expert at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said it would be impossible to determine simply from the decline in price whether prices were manipulated. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told the Senate panel it would investigate Enron's influence on wholesale electricity prices. 
The Associated Press contributed to this report.

White House Confirms Lay Memo But Hasn't Seen Lawsuit

01/30/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON (AP)--The White House said Wednesday it hadn't received notification of the lawsuit to be filed by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. 
A congressional source said Wednesday that GAO has decided to sue the White House for access to documents from President George W. Bush's energy task force.
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ""The president will stand on principle and for the right of presidents and this president to receive candid advice without it being turned into a news release."" 
GAO officials were calling congressional leaders Wednesday to tell them of the decision. An official announcement was expected later in the day. 
The White House also said Kenneth Lay, then chairman of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), gave Vice President Dick Cheney a three-page document in April arguing for federal authorities to refrain from imposing price caps or other measures sought by California officials to stabilize electricity prices. 
""Events in California and in other parts of the country demonstrated that the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not reached consumers,"" the memo said. 
Cheney spokeswoman Mary Matalin dismissed the significance of the memo first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. Nine of Lay's 11 suggestions weren't included in the White House energy plan - and the two that made the report were non-controversial, she said. 
A decision had been expected all week from Comptroller General David Walker, GAO's chief. The GAO wants to force Cheney, who ran the energy task force, to turn over documents on the meetings held last year with business executives as the Bush administration crafted a national energy policy. 
Some of the meetings included officials from the now-collapsed Enron, whose executives have had deep ties to Bush.

Enron collapse memo details Cheney-Enron links

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A memo outlining discussions between Enron officials and the White House reveals the extent to which the Houston energy giant lobbied to influence government policy, despite White House insistence that the details remain secret. 
The memo was given by former Enron Chairman Ken Lay to Vice President Dick Cheney last April when the two met to discuss the administration's response to California's energy crisis, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday.
The White House said Tuesday that aspects of the memo resembled elements of Cheney's energy plan, but refused to say whether the document was included in notes that Cheney now refuses to divulge to congressional investigators. 
The memo contains eight points spelling out Enron's case for why federal authorities should refrain from imposing price caps or other measures sought by California officials to stabilize runaway electricity prices. 
The key point for California was whether soaring wholesale power prices should be limited or whether such prices were just a reflection of normal supply-and-demand dynamics. 
The memo blames California officials for having made only ""limited progress"" in tackling the state's power woes. 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said it was no surprise that Enron had a voice in the formation of the Bush administration's stance on California's difficulties. 
""What the federal government did during the energy crisis was pretend that the problem didn't exist and say that the markets can solve everything, and that's the same thing Ken Lay told the governor,"" Maviglio told The Chronicle.

Judge Delays Ruling On Halting Enron Suits In Texas Crts
By Michael Rieke

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A U.S. district court judge delayed ruling Wednesday on a motion to stop plaintiffs from filing lawsuits in Texas state courts against Arthur Andersen L.L.P.; some of its employees and former executives of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ).
Plaintiff and defense attorneys involved in federal class-action lawsuits in the Southern District of Texas related to the collapse of Enron argued against allowing such cases to proceed, saying they violated the spirit of federal law governing securities law and could interfere with their own suits. 
Lawsuits have been filed in state courts in both Washington and Brazos counties in Texas on behalf of individual investors who lost money as a result of the collapse of Enron. Those suits name as defendants Andersen, four current Andersen employees, one former Andersen employee, and three former Enron executives. 
The cases filed in state courts are intended to circumvent federal securities laws, said Bruce Collins, an attorney for former Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay. Lay is a defendant in the suits filed in Washington and Brazos counties. 
Federal law calls for such cases involving 50 or more plaintiffs to be removed to federal courts where similar cases have been filed, Collins said. 
Although the suits filed in Washington and Brazos counties have fewer than 50 plaintiffs, they should be moved to federal courts, said Rusty Hardin, representing Andersen. Such suits are liable to be a recurring problem because, ""There are 252 counties left"" in Texas where such suits could be filed.

Enron collapse subjects British government, opposition to accusations
By ROBERT BARR
Associated Press Writer

01/30/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

LONDON (AP) - Enron's collapse has cast a shadow over Downing Street, with Prime Minister Tony Blair under pressure to explain how Enron won favorable government decisions after giving financial support to the Labor Party. Questions also are being raised about Labor's relationship with Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditors. 
Opposition Conservatives are seeking to capitalize. But they also accepted Enron's support, and Enron's board included John Wakeham, a well-connected senior figure in past Conservative governments who now may face questioning about the company's collapse.
""What you have here is thousands of words, very little story,"" Blair's official spokesman told reporters Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The Labor Party has confirmed that Enron gave the equivalent of 36,000 pounds (dlrs 50,760) between 1997 and 2000 - at a time when Enron was pressing the government to lift a moratorium on new gas-fired power generating plants. 
The moratorium stopped Enron's plans for a 1,200-megawatt station in southeastern England. By the time the moratorium was lifted in November 2000, gas prices had doubled and Enron did not pursue the project. 
Opposition critics note that Enron spent 15,000 pounds (dlrs 21,000) to host a reception at the Labor party conference in 1998, shortly after the government approved Enron's takeover of Wessex water, which supplies domestic water and sewer service in southwestern England. 
Ralph Hodge, former chairman of Enron Europe, said he had advised the company to sponsor events in conjunction with political parties rather than make direct donations. 
""Meetings were held with ministers and officials on a number of occasions before and after Enron sponsored events at party conferences and conventions. I am certain that these meetings would have taken place irrespective of any sponsorships,"" Hodge said. 
Opposition Liberal Democrat Matthew Tayler has sharply questioned Enron's courting of the Blair government. 
""We know that in the United States Enron used extensive political contacts to seek to further its interests, and there is good evidence of the same happening here in the UK,"" Taylor said. 
""Taking on former Labor employees to lobby for a change in gas policy and bingo, gas policy changes; paying for tables at the Labor Party conference and seeking direct contact at the time of the takeover of Wessex Water and bingo, that is approved."" 
But the Labor Party's general secretary, David Triesman, scoffed at such charges in a television interview this week. 
""The idea that a government switches its policy on energy a week after having a gala dinner is really among the more absurd claims I've heard in my political life,"" Triesman said. 
On Tuesday, Blair's office released details of seven meetings between ministers and Enron executives between April 1988, when Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay met then-Industry Minister John Battle, and October 2000. 
The Department of Trade and Industry said it did not keep records of who initiated each of the meetings. 
Enron's outlay for political contacts - including some 25,000 pounds (dlrs 35,000) to the Conservative Party - pale in comparison to political contributions of dlrs 5.77 million in the United States in the last 12 years. 
The opposition apparently doesn't yet sense a major opportunity to attack Blair over Enron. 
During the prime minister's question session in Parliament on Wednesday, Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith decided instead to probe Blair about problems in the National Health Service and the Labor Party's financial support from a union that is currently disrupting rail service with a series of 48-hour strikes. 
A decade ago, Enron successfully lobbied Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government for permission to build one of the first gas-fired electric generating plants in Britain. 
The minister who approved that project, John Wakeham, joined Enron's board as a non-executive director in 1994 - and now finds himself under fire. 
Nick Harvey, a Liberal Democrat lawmaker, has called for Wakeham to give up one of his most prominent jobs: chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, a politically sensitive post in which he has dealt with complaints from people aggrieved by newspapers, including Blair and the royal family. 
Wakeham has not responded. 
Conservatives also have questioned Labor's relationship with Arthur Andersen, which was banned from doing business with the government because of its association with the De Lorean sports car venture in Northern Ireland. The company went bankrupt in 1982 after its founder, John de Lorean, was arrested in California on drug charges. 
Successive Conservative governments barred contracts with Andersen and sought to reclaim 200 million pounds (dlrs 280 million at current rates) in compensation. 
Shortly after Blair won power in 1997, the government settled the case for 21 million pounds (dlrs 25.8 million). 
Energy Minister Brian Wilson said former Conservative Prime Minister John Major's government set up the machinery which led to the decision to reinstate Andersen. 
John Morris, now Lord Morris, Blair's attorney general from 1997 to 1999, said he made the decision to settle ""entirely on legal advice."" 
""The advice from departmental lawyers was that the sooner the better the litigation ... should be brought to an end,"" he told British Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
Conservative Party vice-chairman Tim Collins complained that the decision was entirely made by Blair's government. 
""It was the Labor Party that decided to settle for only 10 percent of the money the taxpayer was, in our view, owed.""

Bank of America Fires Two Bankers Who Handled Enron
2002-01-30 14:40 (New York)

     New York, Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Bank of America Corp. fired two employees who managed the firm's business with Enron Corp. after the third-biggest bank lost $231 million when the energy trader filed for bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter said.
     The bank dismissed Jo Tamalis, the client manager for Enron, and Marcia Bateman, who oversaw loans to the energy firm, the people said. Tamalis said she no longer worked for the bank and declined to say why. Bateman couldn't be reached. Bank of America spokeswoman Georgie Shields declined to comment.
     Bank of America is the first bank to fire executives because of Enron's collapse. Other financial firms from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. to Citigroup Inc., which wrote off more than $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter because of Enron and Argentina's debt default, may take similar steps, investors say.
     ""If you assume they were responsible, you as an investor like to see people held accountable,'' said Phil Larkins, market strategist for Legacy South Inc., which manages $400 million in assets and owns 200,000 Bank of America shares. ``Bank of America has a very large exposure to Enron.''
     The Bank of America firings are some of the ripple effects in the financial services industry from Enron's collapse. Congressional investigators are demanding names of investors in limited partnerships Enron used to inflate earnings and hide debt from shareholders. Merrill Lynch & Co. executives invested in one of the partnerships, which also drew money from Citigroup, American International Group Inc. and other firms.

Bondholders

     Money managers including Putnam Investments, the fourth largest U.S. mutual fund company, Federated Investors Inc. and Dreyfus Corp. bought bonds issued by Enron trusts, according to regulatory filings. Northern Trust Corp., the trustee for Enron's retirement plan, owned the bonds, and also said this month it held more than $24.5 million in unsecured Enron debt.
     Bank of America was one of the biggest lenders to Enron as part of a $3 billion credit facility that was arranged by J.P. Morgan and Citigroup.
     Bank of America shares gained 1.37 to $60.56.
     ""Bankers have made a lot of bad judgment calls regarding Enron,'' said Carl Domino, president of Northern Trust Value Investors, which holds Bank of America shares.
     Tamalis, reached at her home in Houston, declined to comment. ""I don't want to give an interview,'' she said.
     The largest bankruptcy helped push J.P. Morgan and FleetBoston Financial Corp. into their first quarterly losses in years. J.P. Morgan Chase wrote off $456 million of trading losses and loans to Enron and still has exposure to potential losses of $2.06 billion. Bank of America said this month loans and other business with Enron cost the company $231 million.
     For Bank of America, the losses on loans to Enron came after a string of bad loans hurt the firm's earnings. The bank wrote off a total of $1.19 billion of bad loans in the fourth quarter, up 11 percent from a year earlier.
     ``Enron may well have been the straw that broke the camel's back,'' Domino said.
     Congress will be looking into the role of Enron's financiers, especially those in the limited partnerships, in hiding debt from investors, said Representative Henry Waxman, a California
Democrat.
     ``This needs to be thoroughly investigated,'' he said. ``One of the big mysteries about Enron is who the secret partners were, what they knew about Enron's precarious financial situation, and whether they did anything wrong.''

Other Cuts

     Bank of America said last year it planned to cut 600 jobs in corporate and investment banking to help reduce costs. As part of those cuts, the bank is firing three loan syndication executives who worked in project finance: Parker Knight, managing director and head of international syndicated finance, Brian Goldstein, head of U.S. project finance syndications, and John O'Neill, head of Asian project finance.
     Their jobs are being cut as part of Bank of America's restructuring of its global corporate and investment bank, said William Hodges, the bank's head of debt capital markets.
    ``The impact on these three individuals leaving the company is not related to Enron in any way,'' Hodges said.
    The bank is scaling back lending for capital projects, such as refineries and generation plants, in the U.S. and Asian energy and power industries, Hodges said. That type of lending ties up capital, and Bank of America isn't willing to continue doing it unless borrowers agree to give the bank more lucrative business as well.
    ""It entails risk factors that are less than highly desirable,'' Hodges said.
     Loan syndication employees in Latin America and Asia who previously reported to Knight now report to executives in those regions. ``In Latin America and Asia, we now have a regional model,'' Hodges said. ""The head of the region is now responsible for all of our client coverage and business development.''
     Hodges said Bank of America is ceasing, on a stand-alone basis, traditional project finance in the U.S., a unit headed by Goldstein, and in Asia, a unit headed by O'Neill.

Lawmakers Fear 'Loopholes' In Electricity Deregulation Bill

01/30/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Mutual fund investors could be stung by future Enron-type collapses if Congress adopts an electricity bill with ""potentially dangerous loopholes,"" some House Democrats warned Wednesday. 
In a Jan. 30, letter to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Edward Markey, D-Mass., said they fear fund investors could be stung by loopholes in the bill, HR 3406.
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, would deregulate markets for electric power. 
A section of the bill would ""grandfather"" existing holding companies, allowing them to avoid rules governing mutual funds. Dingell and Markey said they are ""extremely wary"" of that, fearing it might allow grandfathered utility holding companies to spinoff firms that wouldn't be subject to the same rules as other mutual funds. 
""They could therefore engage in some of the risky and speculative investment strategies pursued by hedge funds,"" exposing investors to enormous risks, the lawmakers wrote. 
A House subcommittee may act on the bill as early as next month. Given that, Democratic lawmakers asked the SEC to analyze the bill, including the proposal to grandfather holding companies in existence at the end of 2001. 
In a related area, lawmakers asked the SEC to provide information on a 1997 SEC staff decision to exempt Enron from being regulated as a mutual fund. 
Among other things, the Democrats asked whether ""some of the potentially fraudulent actions subsequently undertaken by Enron might have been prevented"" if it had been subject to mutual fund rules.

Shareholder Files State Lawsuit Against Enron Execs
By Erwin Seba

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- An Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) shareholder filed a class action lawsuit Friday in state court in Houston against Enron's current and former executives and directors.
Henry P. Blaskie, Jr., of Columbus, Ohio, is also suing Enron's former auditor Arthur Andersen LLP. 
Among the defendants, the suit names ""the estate of J. Clifford Baxter."" 
Baxter, a former Enron vice chairman, was found dead in his car early Friday morning by Sugar Land, Texas, police. Police said Baxter suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and have described his death as an apparent suicide. 
The suit was filed late Friday afternoon in Harris County District Court. 
Former Chairman Kenneth Lay, former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow were also named in the suit. 
Blaskie alleges the executives and directors ""breached their fiduciary duty"" by releasing misleading financial statements which encouraged shareholders to continue ownership of Enron stock. 
Blaskie also alleges Andersen aided in the breach of fiduciary duty by certifying the company's financial statements. 
Blaskie is represented by Houston Attorney John Emerson. Blaskie is suing on behalf of himself and all those people who bought Enron stock before Oct. 16, 1998, and held the stock through Oct. 16, 2001. 
Blaskie owned 700 shares of Enron common stock. 
Attorneys for the defendants were unavailable for comment Wednesday afternoon.

USA: Ex-Enron executive Baxter euologized for successes.
By Nicole Volpe

01/30/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

AMITYVILLE, New York, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Family and friends of J. Clifford Baxter, the 43-year-old former Enron vice chairman who died of an apparent suicide last week, gathered on Wednesday to recall a life they said should not be eclipsed by the way it ended or by scandal at the company he led for seven months. 
""The shame is that the whole world is going to know him as the vice chairman of this big company where things went crazy,"" said John Bochicchio, a friend who graduated with Baxter from Amityville High School. ""We knew him here in Amitvyille growing up as a great guy, playing ball and climbing trees. It's a very sad day.""
The Houston-based energy trading company's murky accounting practices led to its December spiral into the largest U.S. bankruptcy in history. 
Baxter, who complained about questionable financial deals at Enron before resigning in May, seven months after being promoted to vice chairman, was found dead of a gunshot to the head near his suburban Houston home last Friday. 
Baxter's death came a day after the start of congressional hearings in Washington on Enron's collapse. 
He resigned for what the company said was a desire to spend more time with his family in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land. But an August memo from an Enron whistleblower indicated Baxter had feuded with the then-chief executive about methods the company was using to hide billions of dollars in debt. 
About 150 of Baxter's family and friends filled the St. Martin of Tours Church in this small Long Island town. One of his 35 cousins, Steven Garry, gave the eulogy. 
""It is for them and for us an unimaginable day,"" he said. 
""We will always remember what a decent, hard-working, upstanding person he was, not a bad bone in his body,"" said Garry. ""He always knew the right thing to say, he was always there, he was the go-to guy."" 
Large groups of reporters gathered in front of the church, filming the family as church bells tolled at the end of the service. Baxter is survived by a wife and two children. 
Baxter was a defendant in lawsuits targeting Enron's top executives, accusing them of cashing in on insider information.

Dear John, 

 My colleagues and I are working with Australian Power  and Energy Limited (APEL) that is developing a $3 billion synfuel and power  plant project in the Latrobe Valley of Australia in Victoria using brown  coal.

 The power plant project will be 1,000 MW.  Part of the synfuel production will be  clean-burning diesel fuel of about 35,000 barrels a day (worth about  $400,000,000 a year at today's prices).

 APEL was wondering whether Enron could have an interest  in marketing the power and/or the diesel fuel.  APEL also would be open to suggestions  should Enron wish to be involved in other ways.

 The principals APEL are in Houston this week and could  meet with Enron this Thursday afternoon, 19 July.  

 John, would or your colleagues like to meet with APEL  this Thursday, and if so, what time and where would be convenient?

 Thanks and Best Regards,

 Don Reid

In the Room

Conference attended by all in-state generators, a few munies, the IOUs and a 
few others. One attorney from CPUC, but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended 
for CA Large Consumers.  Nader sent someone.  No other consumers.  One other 
ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego).
Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the 
IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The 
prices are quite divergent.  He expresses concern at the little offered.
Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible 
on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers).
IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g., 
BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so.
Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now.
Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part 
existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with 
the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate 
increase.
Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough
Enron able to take low profile.
SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing 
could be achieved.
Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed 
epithets at SDG&E and SCE.  SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning.  

Out of the Room

Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators.
Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs.
Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC 
involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable 
resolution.

Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks

Judge asked everyone to consider how to ""Share the Pain"" for Thursday's 
meeting and said not to expect any ""win:win"" scenario. His view is that FERC 
is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court.
His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in 
12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its 
supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward 
contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates.  Generators oppose 
this, I believe.
Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA."

Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know:

The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension.
With minor exceptions, the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didn't need to conduct hearings, and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees.  
The utilities said that hearings could be held ""sometime later"" to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward.
A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings.
There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference.
The next hearing will be on Dec. 12th.
The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday.
In sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues.
At this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings.
Of particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either. (Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.)
The judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues).
Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.  
Though the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity.
Interestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection.  
The judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.  
As a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue.
The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., ""why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info,"" etc.
From today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.  
In related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in ""serious negotitations."""

Rick,

Just wanted to give you a ""heads up"" that I will be digging around the DOJ 
regarding satellite issues as we have a potential antitrust issue on that 
front.  According to Fred Enochs (runs the satellite book for Fallon), 
satellite providers (and there are only a few of them to begin with) will not 
sell capacity to EBS unless we agree to their contractual terms regarding 
resale -- i.e., we cannot resell any satellite capacity that the provider 
sells to EBS.  As we are interested in trading satellite capacity, this type 
of restriction prevents players like EBS from creating/entering new markets 
for resale.  I have already touched base with Jade and she has promised to 
find the appropriate person for me to talk to.  

FYI: Fallon would like to see this prohibition attacked as well.  The three 
of us have discussed it.  I advised Fred that I would need either a contract 
from one of the providers that includes the restrictive language or some 
correspondence (e-mail or regular mail) that documents this activity; he is 
working on it.  As it turns out, Jamie Ginsberg's new company contacted EBS 
about satellite capacity and she related similar information to Fred 
regarding her own experiences with satellite providers.  As a result, we may 
be able to gather some useful information from her that we could reference at 
the DOJ to support our case.

I'll keep you posted as further developments arise.  

Hope you're enjoying San Antonio.

Lara

P.S.
Are you around at all tomorrow or next week?"

I talked with Theresa Voss about the insurance on the peakers and she said 
that they have been making payments on the peakers and that this ""billing 
separately plan"" on the peakers will last until March of 2001.  At that 
point, an umbrella plan will cover the turbines.  Regarding the balance 
sheet, they have been accounting for it under prepaid insurance and have been 
amortizing it each month as its been paid.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

There are a few points in here that you might be interested in - or not.

To: Edmund Cooper/LON/ECT@ECT
cc: gilbergd@sullcrom.com 
Subject: Re: EnronOnline - Credit Product Documentation  

Edmund:

Thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay, just a couple of 
questions and minor points ont eh GTC - 

In paragraph 1, the usual practice in North America would be for the executed 
confirmation to control over other evidence.

Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master 
agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions 
should not be included when they determine their rights to call for 
collateral under the masters.

I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.  Is 
this particular to credit derivatives?

With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that 
these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by 
the Mater User.  It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the 
authority to amend the ETA.  Is the purpose of the second sentence to 
""deactivate"" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction?  
If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a 
master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected 
counterparties.  (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty 
execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC 
would acknowledge that the master did not control.)

I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy 
Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is 
impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.  If we 
actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have 
the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods 
for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to 
more than 60 days).

I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term ""Month.""  What would the Effective 
Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?  You could argue that 
it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March.  
The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day 
convention.

This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives  -  should we apply a 
different interest rate to non-US$ payments?

It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives 
trading agreements be subject to arbitration.  We rarely submit to the 
jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the 
US.  Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some 
straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.

Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we 
decided not to include one here for a particular reason?

Again. sorry for the delay.  I will be here all week and happy to discuss any 
of these points.

Mark

Subject: Re: EnronOnline - Credit Product Documentation  

Dear Gavin,

Thanks for the latest drafts of the GTCs. 

I have spoken with Paul about the comments on the GTCs from Tax in Houston, 
and I have also spoken with Tax in London, and there are a few small changes 
to the tax provisions of the GTC which London Tax feel appropriate.  I have 
marked-up the proposed amendments and have also made a few other small 
tidy-up changes as well.

I have made the changes to the US GTC (with collateral) and these changes 
should be reflected in all the other GTCs EXCEPT that the amended references 
to ""the United States"" in Section 11(B) should remain as references to ""the 
United Kingdom"" in the non-US and non-Canadian GTCs.  Please let me know if 
this is unclear.

Unless you have any comments on these revisions, please could you prepare 
amended versions of the GTCs in anticipation of any final changes from local 
counsel.

Many thanks,

Edmund.

Highlights:

Direct access customers are exempt from the surcharge. 
In giving its first hint on what it will do with the PX credit process, it 
said ""we will proceed to reexamine and redesign the direct access credit 
system to reflect current structural reality.""  (Translation - no 
market-based PX credits)
Each customer class is allocated an equal 3 cents, plus an amount to cover 
the shortfall from having residential usage up to 130% of baseline exempt 
from the surcharge (as required by law). Responsibility for residential 
subsidy is split one third each to residential, commercial, and industrial
The new rates become effective June 1, and the shortfall from the actual 
effective date of the increase, March 27, through June 1 will be amortized 
over 12 months.
Residential rate design - 5 tiers put in place.  No increase up to 130% of 
baseline (first 2 tiers), rate for fifth tier (above 300% of baseline) is 
about doubled.
Non-residential rate design - recommendations to put all of the increase into 
summer on-peak were rejected.  About 60% of increase put into summer.  
Industrial customers get a bill limiter which caps the average increase for a 
given customer to 12.3 cents/kwh for PG&E and 12.9 cents/kwh for SCE.
Real Time Pricing was endorsed - will further explore in workshops starting 
later in May.  Voluntary program will be started.
Federal facilities will be subject to a market rate pilot program.
Utilities are directed to specifically state on each bill the energy charges, 
including the 3 cent surcharge


Below is a more complete summary of the CPUC decision on the PG&E/SCE rate 
increase (prepared by Jeanne Bennett).

I have yet another El Paso question.  We currently have two masters with El

through several name changes.  We need to know which master to keep

Jim and Harry:

This is our proposed amendment to fix the ""ban"" on direct access.  It
works off of the concept of CMA, which allows the CUC to impose some
conditions or fees, but it clarifies that the CPUC can't hit direct
access customers with costs they didnt cause.  Call Sandi ASAP to
confirm approval.  We need to get this to staff within 30 minutes or it
will be too late.

 Thanks for the fast turn around.   Mike Day

Jeff, 

I wanted to call attention to one of the new PG&E rate schedules (G-CFS) 
which Randy Litteneker distributed on Friday evening. 

The Assigned Storage Monthly Charge under G-CFS indicates the charge will 
become retroactively effective January 2000. How can PG&E implement a back 
charge of this nature? I believe these charges under this rate schedule 
should not commence until April 2000. The basis for my argument is as 
follows....

Proposed Schedule G-CT indicates that ""In any storage year under this rate 
schedule, a CTA will be allowed one annual cycle for injection, inventory and 
withdrawal of gas in storage."" While the typical storage year remains in 
effect, the charges would start in mid storage season when operational and 
economic decisions have already been completed. 
Proposed Schedule G-CT indicates that ""Prior to March 1, each CTA will be 
given the option to reject a percentage of its initial Storage Allocation, up 
to 100 percent (%), for the upcoming storage year of April 1 through March 31 
(Storage Year)"". This option was not given for the current storage year April 
2000 - March 2001. Further evidence in the current Schedule G-CT states that 
""PG&E will allocate to the CTA, acting on behalf of Customers in the Group, a 
pro rate share of of PG&E's total core storage capacity reservations."" The 
current schedule makes no indication of ability to reject any allocated 
portion.

I apologize for continuing to harp on this issue but as stated in proposed 
G-CFS, I would incur charges of $506,700 (this is different from the $420,000 
I mentioned on the phone because I neglected to include the capacity we will 
receive from the PG&E Eneryg Services acquisition. This charge would 
obliterate the Gas Desk goals for 2000. 

Please call me to discuss when you have a chance. Thanks. 

Tim

Subject:	Steering Committee Meeting - Global Accounting Priorities

Even though a number of us are swamped with work related to the issues Enron is currently facing, progress has been made in three of the priority areas.

The purpose of the first Steering Committee meeting was to review (1)team members and (2)plans for the first 30 days.  For those teams who have named a lead (Reporting, Communications, and Human Capital), George Wasaff and I propose that we continue with the status meeting originally scheduled for November 1 from 10-11:30 with those team leads who are able to participate (Jan Johnson, Carol Howes, and I) and any Steering Committee members who are available.  Documentation indicating team members and plans can be made available to those unable to attend.

The five priority areas were expected to move at different speeds, so we can initiate the other two teams once time permits.

Please let me know if you are able to participate, and/or if you have any problems with this proposed path forward.

Thanks!"

An excerpt from a SD Union Tribune article this morning, and I quote:


The governor will spend most of this month signing and vetoing hundreds of
bills passed by the Legislature before adjournment last week. He said he
will meet with power generators and ""immerse"" himself in the electricity
issue next month before proposing reforms in November.

""If people don't act responsibly I am going to name names and publish a list
out in my reception area,"" Davis said. ""We have to do this together.""

The governor said that ratepayers, utilities and power generators will all
have to ""accept their fair share of pain."" He called on all Californians,
including businesses and environmentalists, to act responsibly to bring
electricity supply and demand into balance.

Hinting at reforms, Davis said there may have to be a restructuring of the
industry-dominated Independent Systems Operator, created under deregulation
to run the transmission system and make some power purchases needed to keep
the grid operating.

""Over time I think deregulation will reduce bills,"" Davis said. ""I wasn't
part of putting it in place. I have inherited this. But I believe it can
work.""

 On deal 117413 for Dec 99, could you change the first tier from 750,000 to 
775,000?  The volume is the first 25,000/d.   I need this in order to get the

Bob,

Please, give me an advice. The students from Rice wrote a report
about EOL from which we extracted this article.
We can publish it in out internal research weekly newsletter
but I would like to make sure that we don't cross the line.
The newsletter is internal but somebody can always capture the screen
and distribute it electronically outside Enron (or get a hard copy).

Who else could help to review it?

The feeling on the street is that Reliant was setup with the $1900 sale.  The 
word is that the bid for $1900 power had been sitting there for months and 
that Reliant had an ""understanding"" with DWR and the ISO that the bid was not 
supposed to be taken except in dire need -- it's for a peaker and the price 
represents the opportunity cost of running it now, and using up its very 
limited emission credits, rather than running it during the real peak times 
this summer. The $1900 represents the estimated cost to Reliant of Reliant 
having to buy power this summer on the market when it otherwise would have 
had its peaker available.  The wors is that the state/ISO took the bid, when 
there was not dire need, just to make Reliant look evil and point to ever 
higher prices -- when? -- yes, the week before the Bush plan was to come out.

Press Release

Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for 
Solutions

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2001--Reliant Energy strongly disagrees 
with California Governor Gray Davis' recent characterization of the company 
as being ``obstructionist'' and opposing court orders. 

Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated 
attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing 
the state's energy crisis. The accusations are simply not based on fact. More 
importantly, the governor's attacks have done nothing to increase the state's 
supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer. If 
anything, the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and 
uncertainty that have further destabilized the market. 

``Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations 
and focus on true solutions to California's energy shortage,'' said Joe Bob 
Perkins, president and chief operating officer, Reliant Energy Wholesale 
Group. ``We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market, 
not government control of power generation, and we have offered solutions 
that do not jibe with the governor's political agenda. Contrary to the 
perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote, we have been focused on 
providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the 
outset of this crisis. In fact, earlier this week we provided the governor's 
office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that, if pursued 
quickly, could help mitigate the power crisis this summer. We are still 
waiting on a response.'' 

Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the 
lights on in California, disputing the accusation of being 
``obstructionist'': 

Reliant Energy has run its 30-to-50-year-old plants at the highest levels 
since their purchase in 1998. In 2000, Reliant nearly doubled the output from 
these plants to meet the needs of Californians -- running them at levels far 
exceeding the prior owner, Southern California Edison.

Reliant Energy invested $80 million dollars in 2000 alone to upgrade plants 
to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times. In 
addition, the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment 
and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum.

For the last two years, Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities 
and the state to invest in long-term contracts to stabilize rates instead of 
relying on the spot market. In particular, Reliant Energy offered to sell 
power at two cents per kilowatt-hour if the buyer would purchase the natural 
gas required to generate the power, ensuring a transparent cost of power.

Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns 
that continue to exist over credit issues. In contrast, just last week a 
major out-of-state supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless 
payment was forthcoming.

Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage 
businesses to ``sell back'' power voluntarily to add more power to the 
Western power grid. The company has met with many leaders in Western states 
to introduce the program, yet California officials will not even engage in a 
dialogue on the program. 

``We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues one-on-one with the 
governor,'' Perkins said. ``Unfortunately, he has repeatedly refused this 
request over the past year. Last week's meeting with generators was the first 
time the group was allowed to speak with him directly, and obviously the 
purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding.'' 

Perkins added that the governor's accusations of opposing court orders are 
unfounded. ``We have always worked within the law and are proud of our 
commitment to keeping the lights on. We have followed all court orders and 
worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all 
investigations. When necessary, we have filed court challenges to orders that 
we believe violate our rights -- hardly an illegal action.''

Just following up on two topics.
One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact 
his P&L is never close to that.  Can you check that his exotics book 
positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.

Second:  Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer

For those who did not have time to watch the third and final presidential
debate Tuesday night, I've prepared this transcript of what was said:

Jim Lehrer:
Welcome to the third presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and
Gov.  George W.  Bush. The candidates have agreed on these rules: I will ask
a question.  The candidate will ignore the question and deliver rehearsed
remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters.  The opponent will
then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens into
voting for him. When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper softly
while he continues to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more
minutes.

Let's start with the vice president.  Mr.  Gore, can you give us the name of
a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that
strains the bounds of common sense?

Gore:
As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love the way we
have so often during the 30 years of our rock-solid marriage, the
downtrodden have a clear choice in this election.  My opponent wants to cut
taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans.  I, on the other hand, want to
put the richest 1 percent in an ironclad lockbox so they can't
hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who is here tonight.  Mrs.
Frampinhamper has been selling her internal organs, one by one, to pay for
gas so that she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me.
Also, her poodle has arthritis.

Lehrer:
Gov.  Bush, your rebuttal.

Bush:
Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, crying with
them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists.  I want to
empower those crying people to make their own decisions, unlike my opponent,
whose mother is not Barbara Bush.

Lehrer:
Let's turn to foreign affairs.  Gov.  Bush, if Slobodan Milosevic were to
launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be able to
pronounce his name?

Bush:
The current administration had eight years to deal with that guy and
didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do about that
guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies.  And then Dick would present
me several options for dealing with that guy.  And then Dick would tell me
which one to choose.  You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough
foreign policy decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New
Mexico.

Lehrer:
Mr.  Gore, your rebuttal.

Gore:
Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly interested in. I
served my country in Vietnam.  I had an uncle who was a victim of poison gas
in World War I.  I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian War.  And when
that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a way
that any undecided woman
voter would find romantic.
If I'm entrusted with the office of president, I pledge to deal
knowledgeably with any threat, foreign or domestic, by putting it in an
ironclad lockbox.  Because the American people deserve a president who can
comfort them with simple metaphors.

Lehrer:
Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security system?

Gore: It's a vital issue, Jim.  That's why Joe Lieberman and I have proposed
changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to every senior
citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny until the
year 2250.  In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion over the  next 10
years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to
their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them with
the child-proof cap.

Lehrer:
Gov.  Bush?

Bush:
That's fuzzy math.  I know, because as governor of Texas, I have to do
math every day.  I have to add up the numbers and decide whether I'm going
to fill potholes out on Rt.  36 east of Abilene or commit funds to reroof
the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds.

Lehrer:
It's time for closing statements.

Gore:
I'm my own man.  I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will
fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning the
White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me.

Bush:
It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no one but
Republicans.

Lehrer:
Good night.

Nice work Kerry and Barb.  I think we should do the follow up work on setting 
a follow up meeting with the Senator.  Ken left it open whether he would be 
available when the Sen is in Houston, so we have made no commitment in that 
regard.

Thanks Steve. 
That's great news.  Just as an FYI, the memo that Ken worked from was 
prepared by Kerry Stroup and Barbara Hueter who are the leads on Missouri.  
As a follow-up, will Sen. Kinder be contacting Ken Lay directly or should 
Kerry and Barbara contact Sen. Kinder's office as the date gets closer to 
make arrangements? 
Please advise.
Thanks,

Ken talked to Sen Kinder.  He made the points you had prepared.  Kinder 
agreed to shelve the legislation for this session.  He said he had been 
hearing from several others, including Proctor and Gamble (which has a big 
facility in his district) that the legislation was not going to help 
competition develop in the state.  He expressed willingness to work with us 
on a better package and also expressed interest in coming to Enron's 
offices.  He is going to be in San Antonio in August and would like to come 
to Houston around that time.

what is up with leaving me off the email this morning?  You don't want me to come work for you too?  My feelings were hurt.  Hope things are going well in San Antonio.  We need to get back to Vegas so I can gamble away what is left of my retirement.

To signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement:

ALJ Biren has given us until Friday of this week (April 28, 2000) to file
""errata"" to the Comprehensive Settlement.

So far, I am planning to make the following non-substantive changes:

1.  The table of contents was seriously messed up by an ""automatic update""
feature in Word just before we duplicated and filed.  I will be putting it
back to the state you saw in the final draft.

2.  On p.7, section 1.12, put a period at the end of the last sentence.

3.  On p.9, section 1.1.3.1,  two thirds of the way down the page, I will be
changing ""subject to adjustment annual by the base rate PBR formula"" to
""subject to adjustment annually by the base rate PBR formula"".

4. On p.27, section 1.5.4, in the third full paragraph on the page, I will
be changing ""If only one customer has an OFO day"" to ""If only one customer
class has an OFO day"".

5.  Also on p.27, section 1.5.4, bottom line on the page, I will be filling
in the blank with ""C"" (so it reads ""Appendix C"")


In the category of ""maybe substantive"",

1.  On p.10, section 1.1.3.2, three lines from the bottom of the page, the
date ""October 1, 2000"" would be changed to ""October 1, 2001"".  This sentence
refers to including the cost of backbone transmission for core customers
buying gas from SoCalGas in the ""procurement"" rate.  Obviously, our intent
was to do that only once we had unbundled backbone transmission, which
happens on October 1, 2001.


In the category of ""substantive"":

1.  Our capacity term sheet had said that we would unbundled ""additional""
(non-reliability) storage for CTAs effective upon implementation of the
settlement (See p.4).  The filed settlement managed to drop the section that
provided for this option for CTAs prior to the principal storage change on
April 1, 2001.  (The filed settlement is ok for the period starting April 1,
2001).  So, to be consistent with the term sheet, we need to insert
something back into the settlement to allow CTAs to opt out of
non-reliability storage in the period from the effective date (90 days after
approval) to April 1, 2001.  Obviously, this may not be a very long period.
John Leslie has suggested inserting at the very beginning of Section
5.4.4.3:  ""In the partial storage year beginning on the effective date of
this Settlement Agreement, and....[continue with current text].""  We would
need to cover as part of implementation filings the exact mechanism/pricing
for SoCalGas purchasing gas in storage owned by CTAs if they opt out of
nonreliability storage prior to April 1. 2001.  SoCalGas and SDG&E are ok
with John's language and want to make sure it is ok with other signatories.


If you have any problems with any of these changes, please contact me or
Brian Cherry by noon on Friday, April 28.  My email is gsullivan@sempra.com
and my phone is (619) 699-5162.  Brian's email is bcherry@sempra.com and
phone is (213) 244-3895.

We are looking at the possibility of two or three additional changes, and
Brian may send you a follow-up message.

Lucy:

Following please find our Corporate Lawyers comments to the changes you
requested to the Guaranty we are working on:

1.	Recitals.  We do not see why it would be necessary to add that
""The Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the
Transactions between the Beneficiary and PMI"".  Please explain.

2.	Section 1.  Considering that Pemex normally needs 5 business
days to request funds in foreing currencies to the Central Bank, we
need to change the payment date to be 5 Business Days after receipt of
the Payment Demand instead of 3 days.

3.	Section 6. Jurisdiction.  We think that New York Jurisdiction is
a good option and probably the most experienced in terms of derivatives
trading, and therefore we prefer to keep the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction
of any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan.

The rest of your comments are acceptable to us.  Carlos Riveroll will
be sending you PMI?s comments to the amendment to the MSA, so we can
finalize this as soon as posible.

Best regards,

Martha Navarro

Subject:	Quality Moves to utilize on your next date

God Bless America. If anyone uses one of these moves please report back to me with your results.  I will attempt the Shanghai Shampoo on my date tonight.

HOW TO IMPRESS YOUR GIRLFRIEND
These are techniques that have been sent to me by various Bunthaus heads. I want to again stress that in no way do we condone the techniques listed here or practice these. Except maybe the Turkey Shoot and the Rear Admiral. And definitely the Spicey Stanley.
Here is a fairly extensive compilation of some of the extraordinary sexual activities that can be performed by men: 
1. Tea bag - As you are sitting on a girl's face, repeatedly dip your scrotum in and out of her mouth, similar to a tea bag in a cup of hot water. An old favorite. 
2. Hot Lunch - While receiving head from a woman, you shit on her chest. (a.k.a. the Cleveland Steamer)
3. The Stranger - Sitting on your hand until it falls asleep and then jerking off, eliciting the feeling of a hand job from someone else.
4. Donkey Punch - Banging a girl doggy style and then moments before you cum, sticking your dick in her ass, and then punching her in the back of the head. This gives a tremendous sensation, but for it to work correctly, the girl must be knocked out so that her asshole tightens up.
5. Golden Shower - Any form of peeing on a girl. (aka: watersports)
6. Pearl Necklace - Well known. Whenever you cum on the neck/cleavage area of a girl, it takes on the look of beautiful jewelry.
7. Coyote - This occurs when you wake up in the room of a nasty skank and you know you've got to give her the slip. However, you realize that your arm is wrapped around her. Therefore, you must gnaw off your own arm to get out of this situation. Can be very painful.
8. Purple Mushroom - This occurs when a woman is giving you oral sex and you withdraw your penis in order to poke it back into her cheek. It should leave a lasting impression similar to a purple mushroom.
9. The Flying Camel - A personal favorite. As she is lying on her back and you are hammering her from your knees, you carefully balance yourself without using your arms to prop yourself up. You then to flap your arms and let out a long, shrieking howl. Strictly a class move. 
10. Double Fishhook - From the doggy-style position, you hook your pinky fingers in her mouth and pull back to achieve deeper penetration.
11. The Ram - Again, you're attacking from behind, when you start ramming her head against the wall in a rhythmic motion. The force of the wall should allow for deeper penetration. Very handy for those lulls in penile sensitivity.
12. Dog in a Bathtub - This is the proper name for when you attempt to insert your nuts into a girl's ass. It is so named because it can be just as hard as keeping a dog in the tub while giving it a bath.
13. The Bronco - Back to reality with this classic. You start by going doggy style and then just when she is really enjoying it, you grab onto her tits as tightly as possible and yell another girl's name. This gives you the feeling of riding a bronco as she tries to buck you off. 
14. Pink Glove - This frequently happens during sex when a girl is not wet enough. When you pull out to give her the money, the inside of her twat sticks to your hog. Thus, the pink glove.
15. The Fountain of You - While sitting on her face and having her eat your ass, jerk off like a madman. Build up as much pressure as possible before releasing, spewing like a venerable geyser all over her face, neck and tits. (Better in her bed) 
16. New York Style Taco - Anytime when you are so drunk that when you go down on her, you puke on her box. Happy trails!
17. Dirty Sanchez - While banging a girl doggy style, quickly stick 2 fingers deep into her starfish, then reach around and wipe the residue on her upper lip, providing her a mustache.
18. Western Grip - When jerking off, turn your hand around, so that your thumb is facing towards you. It is the same grip that rodeo folks use; hence, western. 
19. The Blumpkin - You need to find a real tramp to do this right. It involves having her suck you off while you're on the shitter.
20. The Bismark - Another one involving oral sex. Right before you are about to spew, pull out and shoot all over her face. Follow that with a punch and smear the blood and jism together.
21. Jelly Doughnut - A derivation of the Bismark. All you have to do is punch her in the nose while you are getting head. 
22. Woody Woodpecker - While a chick is sucking on your balls, repeatedly tap the head of your cock on her forehead.
23. Tossing salad - Well known by now. A prison act where one person is forced to chow starfish with the help of whatever condiments are available, i.e. Jello, jism, etc
24. The Fish Eye - Working from behind, you shove your finger in her pooper. Thereupon, she turns around in a one-eyed winking motion to see what the hell you are doing.
25. Tuna Melt - You're down on a chick, lapping away, and you discover that it's her time of the month. By no means do you stop though. When the whale spews, tartar sauce with a hint of raspberry smothers your face. 
26. The Fur Ball - You're chomping away at some mighty Zena who has a mane between her legs the size of Lionel Richie's afro, when a mammoth fur ball gets lodged in your throat. You punch her. 
27. The Chili Dog - You take a dump on the girl's chest and then titty fuck her.
28. Gaylord Perry - Going to only one knuckle during an anal probe is for wimps. Make this famous knuckle-ball pitcher proud and use multiple digits on that virgin corn hole. A minimum of 2 knuckles required (either on one finger or on multiple). 
29. The Rear Admiral - An absolute blast. When getting a chick from behind (with both partners standing), make sure you don't let her grab onto anything when she is bent over. Then, drive your hips into her backside so that the momentum pushes her forward. The goal is to push her into a wall or table, or have her trip and fall on her face. You attain the status of Admiral when you can push her around the room without crashing into anything and not using your hands to grab onto her hips.
30. Glass Bottom Boat - Putting saran wrap over the skank's face and taking a dump.
31. Ray Bans - Put your nuts over her eye sockets while getting head. You're can is on her forehead. Yes, it may be anatomically impossible, but it is definitely worth a try. 
32. The Snowmobile - When plugging a girl while she's on all fours, reach around and sweep out her arms so she falls on her face. 
33. The Dutch Oven - Also well known. Whenever you fart while humping, pull the covers over her head. Don't let her out until all movement ceases. 
34. Smoking Pole - Self Explanatory. Don't use fire.
35. Rusty Trombone - Getting the reacharound while getting your salad tossed. Also known as milking the prostate.
36. Turkey Shoot - When you're coming, come on her face and let it drip off her chin so it looks like that red shit on the turkey's chin.
37. Stovepiping - Taking it in the Tush.
38. Rusty Anchor - After a healthy term of the Stovepiping, the recipient gets to enjoy a good fudgesicle.
39. Sandpiper - A stovepiping on the local beach, desert, or playground sandbox. Also known as the Sandblast. 
40. Lucky Pierre - the middle man in a three way buttfuck. Also known as the french sandwich.

52.Mangry- Describing the anger of women who are angry at men, specifically. ""She's such a bitch, she's just plain mangry.""

55.Antlers- Wide, flat, flapjack titties that come to a sharp point at the nipples.
56.The Kangmin - while a girl is reciting bad poetry, you take her from behind.

58.The Screwnicorn -When a dyke puts her strap-on dildo on her forehead and proceeds to go at her partner like a crazed unicorn.
59.Split pissonality -When you're taking a leak and you get two streams out of the one hole!

67.Intoxicourse- Having sexual intercourse whilst piss-drunk.
68.Valsalva -The act of pinching shut (with thumb and forefinger) a woman's nose while receiving fellatio; most effective when employed just prior to the release point due to the gag reflex and ensuing swallow that the woman is forced to do to continue breathing. A great first date ploy, as it sets the stage for what the rules of engagement will be going forward.
69.Insta-gasm -Pre-mature ejaculation at the sight of a beautiful woman. ie: ""She was so fine, I had an insta-gasm before I could get her clothes off!""
70.Manual Deconstipation -This is where you get out the hand cream and go in manually for the hammerhead by breaking it into smaller chunks and pulling it out a piece at a time.

75. The Twinkler - when you are 69ing a girl and you shove your dick into mouth hard, and you watch her a-hole ""twinkle"" as she gags. 
76. Angry dragon - This involves the girl giving the guy head and as he is about to cum slapping the girl on the back of the head causing the cum to come out her nose. Great care should be used to not slap her mouth shut.
77. Tony Danza - a takeoff of the donkey punch is called the Tony Danza. When you are about to cum while doing a girl from behind, you say ""who's the boss?"" and stick it in her ass. Before she says anything you shout ""TONY DANZA!"" and punch her in the back of the head.
78. Alaskan firedragon - another good take off is one of the angry dragon that is called the alaskan firedragon. When a girl is giving you a blowjob, cum in her mouth unexpectedly and plug up her mouth at the same time. Then whisper in her ear ""i have syphilis"" so she spews it out her nose.
79. The Walrus - when she's giving u a blowjob and u cum in her mouth unexpectadly, cover up her mouth and punch her in the stomach. 
80. The Fat Lip - If you get poison ivy and finger a girl, her labia lips will swell. A la, the fat lip.
81. Sleeping Bag - If you're going down on a really fat girl, you pull her enormous stomach roll of fat over your head.
82. Hummer Bird - when a girl is giving a guy a hummer, and he's enjoying it, she bites on his bird. 
83. Bloody Mary - when a drunk guy is going down on a girl and without even realizing it after he's done, he realizes Mary was very Bloody
84. The Houdini - this maneuver is accomplished while going at it doggy style. As you feel you are about to cum, you pull out and spit on the small of her back (making her think you've finished...). It's at the point when she turns around when *BAM!* You bust your load in her face (in the eye if you've got proper aiming techniques down.) Also known as the Doug Hennings and the David Copperfield.
85. Upperdecking - This one takes practice. This maneuver requires a toilet with a tank above it, like the ones in most homes. Instead of crapping in the bowl, you shit in the tank (i.e. upperdecking). Now don't flush. When the following victim flushes, the rancid waste fills the bowl. If you play your cards right, it may ferment 
86. Journey into darkness - This is the most disturbing of all. It entails shitting into another person's asshole. Not for beginners.
87. Rocky Balboa - dont shower for 2 weeks, then diarrhea down her throat at any point during sexual contact.
88. Rocky Balboa Title Punch - same as the Rocky Balboa, but in that non-showering 2 weeks all you eat is corn. 
I don't usually do this, but I have to give credit to Sascha and Zach for the next 2. I'm only doing this because they are my bosses kids... 
89. The McDonald's Quick Draw - Get your girlfriend to talk dirty into the intercom, making the order guy start to beat off. Then while pulling up to the window, have her give you falatio till you are about to blow your beefy chunk-load. Upon pulling up to the window, tell your girl friend to yell ""Draw!"". Then on ""three"", both you and the guy blow your loads either on her or eachother.
90. Uncle Jemima - the typical dirty chef at your local Denny's or other low-class food establishment who occasionally becomes disgruntled, and takes out his frustration on your meal, via ""the ass wipe"" or the ""French Toast Strut"" seen in Road Trip. 
91. Airtight - this is where a girl has a cock in each of her three holes, hence, airtight.
92. The Throne of Lightning - This is done by fucking a girl while you shit in a toilet. When you're going to blow your load, turn her over and dunk her head in the toilet, while she's bobbing for your turd plummet a river of semen in her ass. Not to be confused with ""Ride the Lightning,"" a Metallica album
93. Abe Lincoln - You're getting a girl up the ass and give her a swift donkey punch to the back of her head, knocking her unconscious. You then turn her around and jerk off and blow your load all over her face. Then you shave her beaver and take the clippings and spread it where you jizzed on her, making a beard that looks like good ol Honest Abe's. 
94. Thanksgiving - Just like the holiday, Thanksgiving is when you do a girl and then she puts her two big butt cheeks on your face like holiday hams. An overcooked thanksgiving is similar to this but instead of just putting the cheeks on your head she farts on it too. 
95. PEUM - An acronym coined by a group of drunk assholes that defines the annoying (and uncontrollable) tendency to piss in multiple directions after a raucous fuck: Post-Ejaculatory Urinary Misfire. 
96. The Beverly Hills Whiffer -This move is restricted to those women who think they're God's gift to the world. Find a woman of the above description. Take her home and start doggie styling her. When you're about to blow, corkscrew two fingers into her ass, scraping as much shit as you can from her. Pull out your fingers, reach around her head to stick one finger in each nostril. Pull her head back so she can see you while you yell ""So, you think your shit don't stink now ?!"" 
97. Shanghai Shampoo - Fuck a chick until you've built up a load large enough to paint a room. Blow it all in her hair, rub it in thoroughly. When it dries it will resemble the crunchy noodles often served with chop suey. 
98 . Frosting the Cake - When you are about to cum, blow a load all over her chest. Then take your dick and evenly spread the Jism around the breasts and over the nipples. Then stick some candles on it and start singing ""Happy Birthday."" Then blow out the candles 
99. Spicey Stanley - When a girl takes hot sauce and pours it on your cock. She then proceeds to give you a blowjob, making sure all of the hot sauce is gone.

Kay,
Lisa asked me to see if you would represent ENA Legal at the meeting between 
EE&CC and ENA on Monday, Jan 29th.  Having worked at both companies, you 
would add a lot of insight to the crafting of a ""new project development 
process"".  The agenda is for Ozzie, Mike Coleman, Lisa and you to give brief 
presentations (5-10 minutes each) on the project development process, with 
recommendations on changes to be made.  You've already seen the notes, but 
I'm attaching an updated version.  

Please let me know if you will be available and if you want to change any 
discussion bullets and/or recommendations.  The most recent message had the 
meeting taking place on Monday, January 29th from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm (with 
lunch provided).  Megan will let everyone know which room will be reserved.  
There is also a pre-meeting tomorrow (Wed) at 10:30 am in EB 2868 (it should 
only last 30 minutes).  Thank you in advance for your help.
-Catherine

Subject: Ledford and Fehr (Illinois Options)

Kay,

When the Ledford's and Fehr's signed the Option Agreements, they did not date 
on the signature page however, October 2, 2000 was inserted on page 1 (the 
Cover Sheet).  Can I insert October 2, 2000 as the effective date on the 
signatue pages?

Also, Paragraph 15 of the Option Agreements refers to a Memorandum to be 
executed and recorded in the office of Recorder of Deeds.  Do you know where 
these documents are?  It may be that outside counsel has them and will record 
them.  If not, I guess we should follow up?

Kathleen

Subject: Manual JE info for cutover weekend

Attached is the template to be used for inputting manual FI and CS journal 
entries for cutover weekend.  The template will be used for both June 
Hyperion entries that were made and need to be input into SAP for June, as 
well as for any manual entries that didn't get into June MSA or Hyperion but 
need to be reflected in SAP for June (an example would be an intercompany 
imbalance that didn't get corrected by June in Hyperion).  There are some 
Hyperion entries that were made in June that shouldn't go into SAP, such as 
entries that were made to record equity earnings in consolidated subs.  These 
specific entries were made for tax reasons, but going forward, SAP will 
record these entries automatically.  If you have any questions about whether 
or not a Hyperion entry should be included in SAP, please contact me or Cindy 
Morrow.

There will be a box in Cindy Morrow's office to drop off any entries that 
need to be made.  We are requesting all manual entries converted from June 
Hyperion entries to be dropped off no later than noon on Thursday.  This will 
allow time for the SAP team to key in the entries prior to Saturday so the 
data will be in SAP when we get to work on Saturday morning.  Please include 
copies of the Hyperion entries and any other support with the SAP manual 
entries.  For any other entries that need to be made this weekend, we are 
requesting these to be dropped off as soon as possible after the Hyperion 
entries are converted and complete.

I will be available the remainder of the week to assist anyone who needs help 
converting Hyperion entries to SAP, or preparing an entry that hasn't been 
reflected in either MSA or Hyperion as of June but you would like included in 
SAP for June.  Please call me or email me to set up a time.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Elizabeth,

Matt has given me verbal approval to have you change the pricing on the following
transactions.   

	1. SITARA #576162 should be $10.50.   Currently it is $12.35.
	2. SITARA #573532 should be Tiered Rate-Step:   5,000mmbtu/day @ $8.90
							10,000mmbtu/day @ $8.85

Please see the original e-mails below.
I would like to get this booked in May 2001 accounting, so let me know as soon as I can re-draft.
Thanks,

Subject:	Jan-01 Sales Price Discrp

Matt,

Attached are the audio tapes from PG&E regarding two Jan 2001 sales price discrepancies.
The $12.35 vs $10.50 issue relates to SITARA #576162 (first audio file below).
Allen King has said there is no way he would have paid $12.35 at MALIN on that day.
Please see rows 182 & 183 on my attached spreadsheet....is it possible that 
SITARA #576162 was copied from SITARA#575575, but the price is different? 

The second audio file below relates to SITARA #573532 where Allen says the 5,000 is at $8.85.
We show the whole day (1/19/01) at $8.90.....see rows 158 & 159 of my attached spreadsheet.

Please advise....let me know if you have trouble playing the audios.
Thanks,
Doug x3-0560            << File: PG&E Jan 2001 UNIFY - Sales.xls >>

Julie,

Sorry for the delay. Here are he comments.

Vince

************************************

Sorry for long delay in responding. I have a few comments. Most are focused
on the third article as here is till time to make modifications.

1.  In the second article, I would mention that the formulation of the mean
reversion process represents one of several possible equations that capture
the same type of market evolution of prices over time.
2.  One comment that applies to both articles. The problem is how one defines
the time series of energy prices. The numbers used for Australian NSW pool
prices seem to correspond to chronological prices. One alternative approach
is to build different time series for the corresponding time intervals for
each day. This would result in different price behavior and estimates of
jump. The choice is one of convenience and depends on actual problem under
investigation. One could argue that volumes of electricity traded during
different time slots represent different economic commodities.
Figure 3a (Jump Frequency) has units on the vertical axis that require
explanation. Are we talking about an expected number of jumps in the total
number of half hourly periods in a year? The same goes for f in Table 2
(article number 3).

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses

11/29/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego 
Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, 
overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity 
service. 
On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy 
Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), 
AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class 
action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. 
The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A 
news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday 
morning in San Diego.
Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is 
active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate 
contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back 
into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold 
in the state. 
An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable 
to comment. 
The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply 
last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used 
real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. 
The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion 
for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason

John,

Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of 
course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing 
contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still 
wants to receive this payment.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

	The FBI and the Department of Justice have reviewed an Enron Org Chart current as of October 2001, and now are requesting individual Org Charts for your respective 	business units.

	They essentially are trying to understand the teams that work for/report in to each of you, and get a better feel for Enron's business and corporate staff functions.
	For the larger groups, your direct reports and key commercial and staff support should suffice. For the smaller groups, a more complete list of your team would be 	appreciated.

	At your earliest convenience, please provide me with a copy of the following Org Charts:

		1.	Enron Global Services - Stan Horton

		2.	Risk Management/Chief Risk Officer - Rick Buy

		3.	Enron Broadband Services - Jim Fallon

		4.	Accounting/Chief Accounting Officer - Rick Causey

		5.	Global Finance/Treasury - Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen

		6.	Investor Relations - Mark Koenig

		7.	Enron Wholesale Legal - Mark Haedicke

		8.	Corporate Secretary/Board Communications - Paula Rieker

		9.	Enron Principal Investments - Kevin Garland

	Please call with any questions or comments.

Thanks

Sorry you weren't able to join my hunting boondoggle in SoDak!  It was epic.  
Lots of birds (the wild variety, not pen raised and tied down like at 
Pheasant Haven!)  We saw literally 1500-2000 birds over three days of 
hunting, and limited out every day.  Got my first double--two shots, two 
birds, nothun' but net.  You gonna be at the mgt conf?  I'd love to get 
caught up with you and share some new tales of woe from the pipeline 
group.    PS, I met Angie Green yesterday--very sharp young lady.  She said 
to say hi to you and Nicole.  Adios.  DF  "

Hi Folks,

Lots of news so let's jump right  into it.
?
Joe
?
Quarterbacks in the  News:
?
QB  Rob Johnson (Buf) is listed as questionable, but he is not expected to 
play. QB  Doug Flutie will start in his absence.
?
*** Saturday Update? Buffalo  QBs.? This could get ugly.? Johnson said he 
felt that  anonymous negative comments made in the Sports Illustrated article 
were made by  Flutie.? It's still my contention that Flutie is playing for?a  
starting job from here on out.? If he plays well Sunday and the Bills win,  
Johnson had better be for finding a baseball cap he's comfortable with.?  

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is out with a bad shoulder. Jim Miller  starts?in his 
absence.
?
QB Troy Aikman (Dal) will sit with his sore back.  Randall Cunningham will 
take over the reins this week.

QB Brian Griese  (Den) was arrested for driving under the influence. This is 
not expected to  cause any problems for the remainder of this season.

QB Mark Brunell  (Jac) is on a bye and will not play.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) will start with  his sore ribs.

QB Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) has played two games with his  sore neck. Look for 
the same this week.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD) practiced with  the second team. He will likely back up Jim 
Harbaugh for the remainder of the  season.

QB Brock Huard (Sea) is not expected to play this week. Jon Kitna  returns to 
the starting job.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) is out with a broken  pinkie. Trent Green starts in his 
absence.

QB Steve McNair (Ten)  practiced Thursday and is expected to start.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) will  miss at least this week's game. He could be out 
from 2-4 weeks. Jeff George gets  the start in his absence.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Brad Johnson (Was)  is looking like his knee injury 
could be more serious than originally  thought. He has a?""significant"" (grade 
2) tear of his MCL in his left knee  that is close to being a complete tear 
which is a grade 3.? This will get  very interesting if Jeff George plays  
well.

//////////////////////////////

Running Backs in the  News:

RB Michael Pittman (Ari) is expected to start with a sore  shoulder and ribs. 
He left practice early Wednesday to receive treatment, but is  expected to 
play.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Michael  Pittman (Ari) returned to practice late in 
the week and should play  Sunday.? Be careful though.? The ribs are something 
that could easily  become a problem if he takes a hit in the wrong place.? 

RB Obafemi  Ayanbadejo (Bal) is doubtful with a severely sprained toe.

RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) had a successful MRI  and is expected to play 
with his sore ankle. 

RB Corey Dillon (Cin)  appeared to his assault hearing. His lawyers got the 
trial pushed to January 9th  so he will not be impacted this season.

RB Howard Griffith (Den) will  return to the lineup with a sore knee.

RB Terrell Davis (Den) practiced  Thursday and will return as the featured 
back. Mike Anderson will spell Terrell  on a few plays a game.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) continues to miss practice  and is very questionable to 
start this week. If he cannot go, look for Ahman  Green to play in his 
absence.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Dorsey Levens  (GB) missed practice again Friday and 
will be very limited this weekend  if he plays at all.

RB Fred Taylor (Jac) is on a bye and will not  play.

RB Donnell Bennett (KC) could play, but now backs up Tony  Richardson. He has 
no fantasy value.

RB Ricky Williams (NO) practiced and  is expected to play with his hurt 
shoulder.
?
*** Saturday Update RB J.R. Redmond (NE)  injured his foot and will be 
limited Sunday.? Kevin  Faulk?could get the start.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) is  expected to play with a sore knee.

RB Bernie Parmalee (NYJ) will play if  needed. 

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is listed as questionable on the injury  report with 
a sore ankle, but is expected to play.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Tyrone Wheatley  (Oak) is looking very iffy.? Coach 
Jon Gruden is talking like  it'll be all Napoleon Kaufman.? I'd avoid 
Wheatley if you can.

RB  Amp Lee (Phi) is expected to see increased action this week.

RB Natrone  Means?worked out for Philadelphia.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Natrone Means?  (FA)? The Eagles elected to pass on 
signing Natrone Means.?  

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this week. 

RB Jerome  Bettis (Pit) is expected to play with his sore quad.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Jerome Bettis  (Pit) could be without center 
Dermontti Dawson who's Questionable with  a groin although he did practice 
Friday.

RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as  questionable with a sore hamstring.

RB Ricky Watters (Sea) has not  practiced and could be a game-time decision. 
Coach Holmgren has indicated that  he believes Watters will be ready to play 
with pain on Sunday.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Ricky Watters  (Sea) practiced Friday and looks to be 
good for Sunday.?  

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) returned to practice this week, but the team has  not 
commented whether he will rejoin the team this season or not.

RB  Marshall Faulk (StL) has an assortment of ailments, but he is expected to 
play  through the pain. He is holding off surgery until the end of the  
season.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Marshall Faulk  (StL) practiced Friday and looks to 
be good to go for Sunday.?  

RB Marshall Holcombe (StL) is questionable with a sore  hamstring.

RB Trung Canidate (StL) is almost 100%, but he has lost the  back up spot to 
Justin Watson.

RB Eddie George (Ten) practiced Thursday,  but remains questionable for this 
week. He plays hurt so he will likely go again  this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Eddie George  (Ten) practiced Friday and should play  
Sunday.

WR Travis Taylor (Bal) is out with a broken  clavicle.

WR Keenan  McCardell (Jac) is on a bye and will not play.

WR Sylvester Morris (KC)  could use a week off to heal his shoulder, but will

?

and should be good to  go.

WR Tony Martin (Mia) is not expected to play with a sore foot. Oronde

WR Troy Edwards (Pit) is expected to  play with his sore hip.

WR  Carl Pickens (Ten) will likely play, but may not start.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Carl Pickens  (Ten) practiced Friday and will likely 
play.

WR Yancey Thigpen  (Ten) is questionable with a sore hamstring. Do not count 
on him  playing.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Yancey Thigpen  (Ten) has been declared inactive.? 
Like that's news...

WR  Irving Fryar (Was) is listed as questionable. If he plays, he will likely 
be the  #3 WR behind dinged up receivers Albert Connell and James  Thrash.

//////////////////////////////

//////////////////////////////

Kickers in the  News:

PK Mike Hollis (Jac) is on a bye and will not  play.

PK Jaret Holmes (NYG) can play, but it remains unclear whether he  will be 
used or if the team will go with Brad Daluiso again this week. Both of  these 
players are probably worth avoiding this week.
?
*** Saturday Update PK Brad Daluiso (NYG)  is reportedly the kicker this 
week.? Still, caution is probably in  order here.

PK John Hall (NYJ) is expected to play with a sore  quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (StL) is expected back next week. Pete Stoyanovich  will kick 
for the Rams this week.

In Staff's report on its investigation of the bulk power markets in the east, 
the Midwest report notes on page 2-15, Additions to Capacity, that new 
generation has been added in the Midwest region, and that some market 
participants believe that developers sited new generation in the Midwest 
because there were no price caps.  

Steve Kean suggested that we refer to this finding in our November 20 
comments on the California order and specifically draw the conclusion that no 
price caps leads to more generation development.

The Midwest report is attached.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hi.

For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and
deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers.  The daily volumes I have listed
below are delivered volumes.

January 1 - January 6 = 1214 dth per day
January 7 - January 31 = 1489 dth per day


It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume 
of
the increase.  That is an estimate.  Bayer will give us a better idea at the
beginning of January.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you.

FYI
Attached is a a current worksheet of the ETS accounting organization. (Sorry, 
I haven't been able to prepare an org. chart yet). This still reflects Clean 
Fuels as dotted line; but we could easily ""plug"" Kerry and his organization 
into the structure in any one of a number of areas, but most likley would be 
with Jennifer Lev in consolidations. I would like to have nonregulated 
entities kept separate from interestate pipelines -as possible.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Sue,

I noticed Hoecker's statement too.  I do not, however, believe that he is 
breaking new legal ground here, although the reference to Section 309 is (I 
believe) the first time in these cases that FERC or any of the individual 
Commissioners cited specifically to this section of the FPA as possible 
authority for ordering retroactive refunds prior to the 10/2/00 ""refund 
effective date.""  (I have attached Hoecker's opinion; the reference to 
Section 309 is on page 11.)

Section 309 is the provision of the FPA that grants FERC authority to take 
action ""necessary and proper"" to carry out the other substantive provisions 
of the Act, such as ensuring ""just and reasonable"" rates under Section 206 of 
the Federal Power Act; however, the courts have interpreted Sec. 309 as not 
expanding FERC's substantive authority otherwise granted under other 
provisions of the Act; it only provides FERC with authority as necessary for 
it to fill in the ""missing blanks"" in the substantive provisions of the Act, 
such as Sec. 206.)

Several years ago, FERC ordered retroactive refunds in a Washington Water 
Power case where the utility had violated its tariff.  Here, Hoecker is 
simply suggesting that FERC could do the same if it turns out that any seller 
violated the ISO's or PX's tariff last summer by engaging in ""collusion, 
predatory pricing, or unlawful manipulation of prices.""  As long as EPMI 
followed  the ISO's and PX's market rules last summer, I see nothing in 
Hoecker's opinion that undermines our view that the filed rate doctrine 
prevents refunds of all amounts collected in accordance with the market rules 
prior to 10/2/00; i.e., in the absence of a violation of the tariff or FPA, 
nothing in Hoecker's opinion suggests that Sec. 309 modifies the prohibition 
of Sec. 206 against retroactive refunds prior to the refund effective date 
(10/2/00).

Ron

>>> <Susan.J.Mara@enron.com> 01/08/01 02:23PM >>>
Dan and/or Ron,

Hoecker is quoted here as saying (p.2) that FERC has all the authority it
needs to ""disgorge"" profits under Section 309 of the FPA.  What are your
thoughts?  Is this the first time that section has been mentioned?

Hey, man, I called YOU on that after pulling-up the chart and finding
options on the DIA.  I can say this since I'm in the money.  Had I been
losing money right now, it would have been YOUR fault, of course.

The great thing on the options is that this volatility has been great for
me!

Ann Elizabeth,

Lisa Bills has requested some additional changes to the ""form"" of Option 
Agreement I sent you yesterday.  If you will e-mail the form of Option 
Agreement for the new Florida Option to Kay Mann, she will make the necessary 
changes.  Also Ben Jacoby has indicated that  wants to see all new Option 
Agreements prior to them being sent out to anyone so he can be in the loop.

Sorry you missed our meeting.

Kathleen

Ann Elizabeth,

This may not be the absolute latest Form of Option, but it should be pretty 
darn close to being totally blessed (by Herman Manis).  I am also attaching a 
form of Memorandum of Option just in case you need it.

Kathleen

Gentlemen:

Enron is exploring the possibility of becoming involved in a research 
endeavor called the New Economy Value Research Lab. The Lab is the result of 
a joint effort between MIT's Sloan School of Management and Arthur Andersen 
(AA). Its purpose is to develop ""quantitative valuations of the intangible 
assets Wall Street finds increasingly important in the New Economy"" (Business 
Week, 2/7/00). Clearly, as Enron continues to shift from a hard asset to 
intangible asset based organization, the question of ""how to"" accurately and 
appropriate measure and value our intangible assets is becoming increasingly 
important.

Last week, Steve Kean, Vince Kaminski, Marie Hejka, and myself met with a 
team from AA, the Deputy Dean of the Sloan School, and MIT's lead 
accounting/finance professor to discuss the intent of the Lab, expected 
outcomes, and how Enron may be involved. Post that meeting, the decision was 
made to continue to explore participation in the Lab. Enron now needs to 1) 
define our corporate measurement and valuation process needs, and 2) identify 
value attributes important to Enron and the industries in which we operate. 
Once defined, a follow up meeting will be held with MIT and next steps will 
be determined.

Your expertise and assistance could significantly impact the inputs and 
outcomes of these next steps. Please schedule time on Tuesday August 1 from  
2:00 to 3:30 to attend the next meeting, during which we will begin to 
identify needs and define value attributes. Location will be EB 49c4. Please 
notify me if you are unable to attend.

Lastly, to assist with preparation for this meeting, I am attaching notes 
from a recently published book entitled  Cracking the Value Code: How 
Businesses Are Creating Wealth in the New Economy (May 2000, Boulton, Libert, 
Samek - Arthur Andersen).  

Should you like more information on the Lab, previous meeting, book or other, 
please feel free to contact me.

I look forward to meeting you.
Regards,
Amy Oberg

As you know Enron Power Marketing, Inc (""EPMI"") had executed an EEI Master 
Agreement with Commonwealth Edison Company and with the assignment and 
assumption of this Agreement, amongst others, and with no EEI Master 
Agreement in place with PECO, unless otherwise agreed by the parties we will 
assume that this EEI Master Agreement will govern future transactions between 
EPMI and Exelon Generating Company, LLC (""Exelon""). There may be some credit 
issues going forward, however while we have the Exelon Corp. guaranty in 
place in its current form, we do not have any credit issues insofar as they 
relate to physical power trading.

However, in the interim, we will need to clearly identify, at an operational 
level, with whom we are trading. To that end we will be terminating access to 
EnronOnline to all users who are still trading under either PECO or ComEd 
identifications. While we realise that they are trading for and on behalf of 
Exelon, this is an operational matter and we will need to carry out this task 
to reflect the legal position. 
 
This is not to be taken as, and is not a consent by EPMI to any such 
assignment or assumption, but solely a suggested way forward in the short 
term to ensure clarity in any dealings between the new legal entity that is 
Exelon and EPMI
 
 
Kind regards,
 
Marcus

Tom has answered some questions:

12.  EES answered ""NA""; however, Dan, is this OK?

13.. Ramona Richards checked with someone and told Tom that she should be 
listed for EPMI.

15.  The Rhode Island web site only lists ""ECT"" as a retail seller, not 
EPMI.  Is this OK?

The A attachment is now inserted with the annual report and Jeff Hodge is 
providing Q.

Subject: Maine retail license for EPMI

Here are comments on the draft:

12.  ""Location, if any, of any office available to the general public or 
Maine customers:""  The draft says ""N/A"".  Shouldn't we put in Houston 
office?  Dan A's office?

13.  Customer rep. --Ramona in Dublin is EES customer rep.  Who will be ENA's?

15.  Should EPMI's response be limited to supplied RETAIL electricity in 
these jurisdictions?  Otherwise, all 48 states should be listed for EPMI.  
Also, the current EES sales in NEPOOL (New Hampshire and Rhode Island, I 
think) are made by EPMI.  There was/is also a retail sale in the MAPP area by 
EPMI, I think.

21.  EES' response is not exactly true with regard to EPMI, since it has been 
involved in civil legal actions.  However, does this really request any civil 
cases?  Can we answer by saying ""no enforcement proceedings by any state in 
which EPMI is providing retail sales of electricity?"" 

Tom, The application says ""Q"" is attached as other supporting material, but I 
can't find Q.  Also, you marked the Annual Electric Utility Report for 1998 
as ""A"", but I am not sure where it should go (""A"" is already answered.)

Thanks for the information.

Edison International CFO Disputes 'Technical Insolvency' Claim
By Mark Golden
  
10/03/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Edison International's treasurer and chief financial 
officer, Ted Craver, disputed Tuesday a claim made last week that 
California's utilities risk ""technical insolvency"" in 2001. 
Since May, California's three investor-owned utilities have been spending far 
more to purchase needed electricity than they are getting paid by customers. 
As a result, the undercollections in the ""transition revenue account"" of 
Edison's regulated utility unit, Southern California Edison, grew by $1.97 
billion between May 1 and August 31, the company reported to the Securities 
Exchange Commission. 
An article Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, which is published by Dow 
Jones & Co., said that ""if the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed 
the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers, as currently 
seems likely, they could become technically insolvent sometime next year."" 
""The way this term was used insinuated that you take the transition revenue 
account, and whatever the gross number is equates to the amount of debt that 
you would have to raise,"" Craver said in an interview. ""That is not at all 
the way it works. That is not an accurate portrayal."" 
California Gov. Gray Davis acknowledged the concerns Friday, saying, 
""California consumers have a legitimate need for California's utilities to 
remain solvent, and the state must be committed toward that end."" 
But Edison's Craver said the situation is not that simple. 
""That transition revenue account balance says nothing about what we have to 
fund in the market,"" Craver said. ""Southern California Edison has some 37 
balancing and memo accounts set up by the California Public Utilities 
Commission. What we have to fund is the net amount of all of them, plus 
whatever else is going on, and the net figure is considerably smaller than 
the $1.97 billion. It's like picking out one line item on the balance sheet 
and saying this is all that matters. No accountant does that or looks at it 
that way."" 
Craver also said that the term ""technical insolvency"" has no specific meaning 
to him. 
A PG&E Corp (PCG) spokesman declined to comment when asked this week if it 
risks technical insolvency next year. The company is seeking refunds from 
independent generators that have been selling power to the state's utilities, 
and for the future it has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
consider a return to cost-based pricing specific to each generating station 
in the state. 
Utility bond analysts, nevertheless, are concerned about California utility 
debt. 
""I don't believe the utilities are going to go bankrupt, but they don't have 
any assurance from the legislature, governor or regulators,"" Bear Stearns's 
Ted Olshanski said. ""The uncertainty is critical."" 
Bear Stearns has a negative outlook on Edison and PG&E bonds due to the 
uncertainty on the recovery of these energy costs. 
This summer's period of undercollections has continued into the fall, with 
the California's wholesale market for Wednesday power at $135 a 
megawatt-hour, compared with the $65/MWh that SCE gets from customers. 
The current best asking price for on-peak power fall all of 2001 in southern 
California is $85/MWh. 
When asked how long Edison can continue to fund the difference between its 
purchase power costs and the revenue it receives from customers, Craver 
responded: ""How long can ratepayers or anyone afford those prices, which 
don't have anything to do with reality? The market mechanisms don't work."" 
California's utilities are hoping to make significant changes to the market, 
and some of those changes would require action by the state legislature, 
which is out of session until December. 
""I don't know that this is something that waits for the legislature,"" Craver 
said. ""There are a lot of things that can be done before the legislature 
meets. We have significant issues before the FERC and the CPUC."" 
Olshanski said he hoped for a political solution. 
""We're not sure how its going to end,"" he said. ""We expect regulators and 
legislators to step up and provide for a constructive resolution. In the 
past, the California legislature has approved measures to make companies 
whole.""

Subject: ABB Agreement for Review

Here are my comments:

Assignment Language:
in (i) ""WestLB"" should be changed to ""Purchaser""
in (ii) - although this is a business point I think it is important to 
question: why should we provide credit support to the JV/partnership/llc when 
we are required to keep a min. 19.5% interest?  This is not a GE requirement 
and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture 
much more expensive to finance.

Purchase Agreement:
Def. of Business Day:  let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds 
from.
2.1(B):  It should be ""Agent's"" person to approve change orders, not 
""Purchaser's""
2.2:  ""Purchaser"" should be used rather than ""WestLB"" since it is not as 
limiting.
7.1:  Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option 
agreement execution date?
Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation:  The total amount of the three 
purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest 
Option Agreement.  I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of 
the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option 
Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of 
the transformers.

Gentlemen,

I've made some changes to the assignment language of the ABB contract. The 
language is not identical to the LM 6000 language, but is substantially the 
same, and in some respects better.  Please let me know if you have any 
substantive comments:



I am also attaching the current draft of the contract.  It is being revised 
to incorporate delivery dates and to clarify the scope to include 
installation obligations of ABB (haul and install).  Also, in the fourth line 
of the first paragraph, the word ""Purchaser"" will be added to the 
parenthetical, after ""WestLB"". Any other changes should be very minor or 
technical.

We are trying to get this finished this week.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions or comments.

Kay

Homer,

I just left you a voicemail regarding the natsource study.  We have been able 
to pull in the basis and price curves, but we are having trouble getting the 
gas daily curves for June to come in correctly.  I.T. is looking into this 
issue and will have us an answer soon.  Email me and let me know where I can 
save a file out to you with the curves we do have.  The file is too large to 
Email.

Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274"

Summary of Davis/Alpert bill:

1.  Retro-active to June 1, 2000 through December 31, 2002, 6.5 cent/kWh cap 
on the energy component for residential and small commercial customers (under 
100 kW).  The Commission has the ability to extend through 2003.  The 
Commission also has the ability to adjust the cap.
2.  Commission can use revenues from utility-owned assets, refunds from FERC 
to offset the undercollections.  (In addition, a companion bill was passed 
that provides $150 million of general fund money to offset undercollections.)
3.  Large commercial/industrial/agricultural customers have an opportunity to 
""opt-in"" to the 6.5 cent/kWh cap with an annual true-up.
4.  SDG&E will under a prudence review by the CPUC, which may be another 
source of funds to offset the undercollection.

Specific classes subject to cap:

Schedule A, all acute care hospitals, all public and private k-12 schools, 
all accounts on AL-TOU under 100 kW.

The Alpert/Davis Bill (AB 265) and AB 1154 were voted out of the assembly 
last night.  Three bills are now joined together.  The Alpert/Davis Bill (AB 
265), Ducheny Siting Bill (AB 970) and AB 1154, which provides $150 million 
of money from the general fund to offset undercollections resulting from the 
Alpert/Davis bill imposition of a rate cap.  

AB 970 is being heard in the assembly as we speak.  It is expected to be 
voted out.  Then all three bills will be sent to the Governor to be signed. 

There were no revisions to the Alpert/Davis bill.

Green Mountain is working on a letter, that Alpert would sign, saying that 
underrecoveries resulting from the rate cap will be recovered from customers 
that benefitted from the rate cap and that DA customers will not be 
disadvantaged.

Hey Dude,

Yeah the compnay is toast.  The story gets stranger every day.  Half of the=
 Houston office was laid off early December.  More to come I am sure.  My g=
roup was purchased by UBS Warburg.  I am fortunate that they offered me a j=
ob.  A bunch of guys in my group were not.  I feel lucky, things could be m=
uch worse for me, but instead I have an opportunity to be part of a pretty =
impressive organization.  Work has a actually been a little strange, since =
the company had declared bankruptcy we litterally have nothing to do.  Sinc=
e the first week of Dec, I've been going to work for maybe a couple hours a=
 day, just hanging out, talking to the other guys, surfin the net.  It give=
s me the chance to take care of all the errand type stuff I normally don't =
have a chance to.  I've been cooking a lot, taking care of my backyard, sel=
lin shit on ebay, stuff like that.  Some of the other traders have been rea=
ding trading books and stuff, but you know me...  By the way my permanent h=

I got your card that you sent to Adnan.  Thanks.  I'm not sure if I told yo=
u, but I bought a house here a few months back.  When my Dad was planning t=
o move here I thought it would be better to buy a place instead of renting =
a big apt.  It's brand new, location is pretty good in that it is near a lo=
t of things.  Although the area right around here is a bit sketchy.  I figu=
re it'll probably get better over time.  I hope things are going well for y=
ou.  When will you visit the U.S?  If you ever visit LA let me know.  I cou=
ld always meet you there if you give me enough notice.  As you can imagine,=
 airline tickets are pretty cheap these days.

Can you believe Khan is married?  It was kinda strange cuz I was pretty muc=
h the only one of his friends involved in the wedding.  His brother and fam=
ily were able to show up for the ceremony at least.  That was good.  It was=
 a bit difficult because my Dad passed away the morning of his wedding, but=
 I knew I couldn't leave him then.  Khan has some pictures if he hasn't sho=
wn you any yet.  He sent me a couple.  Well I gotta go to bed soon.  I'll d=
o a better job keeping in touch.  It's just been a little difficult lately,=
 I'm sure you understand.  Don't work too hard.

The New Power Company, the first national residential and small business 
energy service provider in deregulated
markets was launched today with strategic investors and partners including 
Enron, IBM and America Online.

H. Eugene Lockhart has been named President and Chief Executive Officer of 
the company.  He was formerly President
of AT&T Consumer Services and Chief Marketing Officer of AT&T, as well as 
President of Bank America's Global Retail
Bank and President and CEO of MasterCard International.  Lockhart is joined 
by a number of high-level executives from
the telecommunications and financial services sectors as well as several 
former Enron executives specializing in energy
commodity pricing, marketing, risk management and government regulatory 
affairs.   

The former Enron employees include Jim Badum, formerly Managing Director of 
Consumer Services at EES, John Henderson, 
formerly Vice President of Retail Risk Management for EES, Dave Eichinger, 
formerly Vice President of Corporate Development
for Enron Corp., and Kathleen Magruder, formerly Vice President of Government 
Affairs for Enron Corp.  Lou Pai, Chairman and
CEO for EES will serve as non-executive Chairman of The New Power Company. 

Enron will provide The New Power Company with energy commodity pricing, risk 
management, and government/
regulatory affairs.  Ken Lay is quoted in the news release, ""We've studied 
the residential and small business market
for several years and believe this is the optimal way to provide value to 
these customers.  By assisting in setting up
an independent company, Enron is able to leverage its core competencies of 
energy and risk management, while
partnering with other industry leaders to give The New Power Company 
extraordinary and immediate depth and
capability.""  Ken will also serve on the Board of Directors.

The New Power Company is scheduled to initially provide service in 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey in the second half
of 2000.  The company will be headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut, with 
some operations in Houston.

 I left both of you a voice mail last night and I listened to it, but you 
probably did not hear my message very well due to a bad line.  Ultimately, 
Cassandra is needing some information on brokerage accounts first thing 
tomorrow morning (Wed., 11/15).  She will be going to San Antonio early 
afternoon and is needing to review a brokerage account document for Ted 
Murphy's signature.  Tana, as I mentioned in my voice mail, when Ted doesn't 
understand information that is requiring his signature, he will not sign it 
until he fully understands it.  Therefore, it is imperative that we get a 
listing of all brokerage accounts and the specific commodity groups they are 
currently work with (if available) to Cassandra as soon as possible; 
otherwise it will have to wait until Monday.  If I remember correctly, most 
of the brokerage agreements that need to be signed require a rush signature.  

Also, Cassandra needs to be able to sign off on these documents as Ted is on 
his way to London effective January 01; therefore we need to figure out a way 
that she should be added sooner rather than later.  I realize that Mark 
Taylor is out of the office until Monday; however, can Alan Aronowitz approve 
this request on his behalf?

Can you please give Cassandra a call at x30429 first thing so we can resolve 
this issue.

I really appreciate your attention to this matter.

You indicated you'd sent the instructions to have me added as a signer 
authorizing the opening  of new accounts, but when I spoke with Bob Bruce in 
Legal tonight, he said I had not been added to his knowledge.  Who did you 
send it the instructions to?  We just need to circle back with Bob so we've 
gone through the right channels.

Charles --

I fully agree that we must integrate the NERC plans and systems (or 
improvements to the NERC model) into our RTO model.  I hope that is something 
you can coordinate with the project as this develops.

Thx,

Subject: Re: Transmission / Wholesale Market Regional Plans  

Jim a BIG external factor that is directed to the item (2) ISO Systems & 
Procedures:

At the NERC Electronic Scheduling Task Force meeting today, there was 
considerable discussion on how this Task Force (which was formed before the 
OASIS ANOPR was posted) would coordinate on an industry-wide basis, a NERC 
response to the OASIS Phase II ANOPR.

Here are some important points a FERC Staff member (Marv Rosenberg) made at 
the meeting.  These should be kept in mind in developing the Enron proposal 
and the process of getting buy-in in each of the Regions/RTOs.

-  FERC prefers a single industry consensus filing.  
-  The ANOPR is intended to tie RTO Order 2000 together with new OASIS II 
requirements
-  Does not preclude individual RTOs or entities from submitting proposals.  
However a diversity of filings will indicate   non-consensus and FERC will 
make its own decisions which will likely not be industry friendly.

FERC is asking the industry for communication and Business Practices 
standards for issuing in a NOPR.

FERC is looking for:
- more functionality and to be more user-friendly
- electronic scheduling
- electronic reservations
- reduce duplication of information entry for customers
- not intended to dictate the Control Area to Control Area communications 
 I asked Marv to clarify this - He explained that although not required, FERC 
welcomes propsals to address the control area   source/sink issues as part of 
an OASIS II solution (ie Entergy Source/Sink Order)

OASIS II should:
- continue use of Web browsers
-  use templates for file transfers (uploads and downloads)
- all displays do not have to look the same - but encourages a common look 
and feel
- within a RTO, business practicese may differ, but between RTOs the 
practices must be standardized

We need to keep close to the NERC efforts since FERC has historically tended 
to favor NERC proposals because they tout an air of industry consensus.  

The clarificaton to the ANOPR given by Marv should make buy-in an important 
element of our proposal.
If FERC adopts the NERC filing, we will likely be stuck with the exisiting 
contract path seams problems and LMP fragmentation in the East because NERC 
is not proposing any tariff changes.  Also we will not get the control area 
source/sink issue resolved since it will be impossible to resolve at NERC in 
7 months.

Of course, another option would be to incorporate our efforts with this Task 
Force.

Subject: Transmission / Wholesale Market Regional Plans


1. I appreciate everyone who participated in the call today.  I think that 
the discussion proved that we can find consensus on a reasonable approach for 
transmission pricing and energy markets.

2. To make more clear about the Regional Plans, I think that we need to 
consider the following.

A. BACKGROUND

Timelines of Current Process
Current Players & Current Positions
Allies 
Key Issues now facing the process

B. MOVING FORWARD

Top Issues upcoming
External Factors (e.g., will Entergy join SPP)
Resource Needs
Relationship to Commercial Objectives / Business Plans

C. OTHER ISSUES / CONCLUSION

I hope this helps set an outline for the Regional Plans.  The key idea is 
that I want to make sure everyone has a calendar of where we are going and 
what issues need to be addressed.  Don't be shy about adding other topics and 
issues.  We need to have this to communicate within our group and to the 
commercial people.  I don't expect this to be easy, but I think that it will 
be helpful.

3. I think that we need to put more detail around the entire structure.  This 
would entail developing four things (1) a tariff, (2) ISO Systems & 
Procedures, (3) Day Ahead PX Energy Market, (4) Transmission Flowgate PX 
Market.  These are the four building blocks to a New Marketplace.

My hope is for Enron to put these things out in a detailed framework using 
""off the shelf"" material.  I know that Tom Delaney has already started 
working on a tariff.  I think we could adapt the Cal PX model into point 3.  
We could probably use the APX Flowgate System for point 4.  On the ISO, maybe 
we could go to ESCA and have a Detailed Scope / Work Plan and fees on setting 
up an ISO (including costs of operation over time).  It would make sense to 
me to do this very formally (including setting energy market zones and 
defining the commercially significant Flowgates).  I would use the MISO as 
the market to focus on, but am willing to listen to other thoughts.

Please let me know what everyone thinks.

Jim

Dan,

I have not followed through with this guaranty because there is currently a 
multiproduct, multientity guaranty in place for several Aquila entities.  HPL 
is already included in the guarantee.  The guarantee is capped at 
$115,000,000.  Just want to make sure that you are aware of why the request 
was not finalized.  Is this in line with your view?

Per our discussion last week, this is the status on Pueblo.  I think we need 
to establish to our satisfaction the bona fides of Dennis' government 
contracting scheme before we pitch hard to have ENA get into the deal and 
scrub down the numbers on the power plant.  If our govcon gurus (Bill Votaw 
and Bill Gang--both ex military guys working on DOD outsourcing deals for 
Enron Federal Solutions) buy off on it, then I think we brief Stan at that 
point.  You, Stan and Steve will then need to decide the best way to pitch 
ENA to verify the economics and potentially get into the deal.  Either we'd 
have Stan push from the top down or have Kevin and  Steve go directly to the 
ENA deal guys.  More to follow.

Subject: Pueblo

I just talked to Tino Monaldo, Dennis Langley's lawyer/project manager for 
the Pueblo project.  I explained Bill and Bill's credentials and concerns and 
Tino suggested that a sit down between Enron and their government contracts 
team might be helpful.  He offered to do it in Houston, probably late next 
week or the following week.  Attending would be Dennis, Tino, and their 
outside lawyers, Jim Slattery and Rick Harrington.  Harrington is the key--he 
is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt. contracts lawyers at my 
old firm in DC.  The would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all 
through their sole source strategy,  including their legal interpretations 
and the allies they have lined up within DOE/DOD.  Bill and Bill--does such a 
meeting sound productive?  If so, should we have outside govt. contracts 
counsel present and if so, who do you suggest?  

On a related note, Tino explained (without me asking or really caring) that 
he was in the middle of a ""big drafting project""--revising Dennis' joint 
venture agreement with the Isleta.  I took the opportunity to express my 
concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, 
including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board.  
I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline 
or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit 
turbines.   Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron 
or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with 
money, turbines, etc.   If Enron does eventually decide to get into this 
deal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be 
revisited.   Thanks for your patience on this project.  DF

 Dear Energy in Europe Congress Delegate

ENERGY IN EUROPE CONGRESS 2000
19th June * 22th June 2000 * Kempinski Hotel , Berlin

I am delighted that you will be joining us to speak at our Energy in 
Europe2000 conference (formally known as Electricity in Europe Congress) and 
enclose copies of the printed brochure for you and your colleagues. I hope 
that you will agree that the programme looks excellent and the response so 
far indicates that the event will be extremely well attended.

I would be grateful if you could just take a moment to look through the items 
we would like from you prior to the conference to help ensure everything runs 
smoothly on the day.

Your Administration/Preparation Details
12 weeks to go!

You will find attached:
  ? PINK FORM : please tick and fill in and fax back immediately
? HOTEL FORM: please tick and fill in and fax direct to the hotel
? MARKETING.DOC: Information for out marketing department, please fill in and 
send back as soon as possible

Friday 26th May 2000 : A Hard Copy Of Your Documentation
3 weeks to go!

  ? We would like a hard black & white copy of  your presentation / bullet 
points/copy of slides whichever is best for you, to insert into the delegate 
documentation. We can receive this by post or email if the documents are not 
too complex but we try not to insert fax copies as copy quality is poor. 
(e-mail address - ttulsi@icbi.co.uk).

N.B. Even if you plan to speak off the cuff, we would urge that you submit at 
least an outline of your speech to us for insertion into the delegate pack by 
the above date. The most consistent complaint that we have from delegates is 
that not all speakers offer hard copies of their presentation.

  ? If you are unable to make this deadline, please could you inform us as 
soon as possible so that we can make alternative arrangements and avoid 
printing delay.

Under separate cover we have arranged for five brochures to be sent to you 
outlining the full programme.  These should arrive very shortly.

Should you have any queries regarding your participation at the conference 
please contact Tanuja Tulsiani, our Logistics  Manager who will be looking 
after the 'domestic' side of the event. You can call her direct on (44) 171 
915 5173 or do contact myself. Thank you once again for joining us and I look 
forward to seeing you in the Berlin.

With kind regards,


Alexandra Howells
Director
Energy in Europe Congress 2000

Dear Sandra and Kenney,
?
I wanted thank you both for having me over for  dinner on Friday.? I had a 
great time and I  am so glad that I finally got the chance to meet Kenney 
and  Samantha.?
?
That Samantha is a doll.? She is certainly a  miniature Sandra.? She has that

Vince,   

Should I be responsible for Li Sun (for PRC)  or do you want Grant since she 
is primarily working for Kevin Kindall?

I think Robert has a good handle on things and can function on his own.  With 
that said, we always want different
checks and balances in place in order to capture the most accurate 
information, so if you see something that is
a problem please bring it to our attention.  Thanks,  Pat

Would you please call Mitcha and get the relevant information?  I suppose 
that a demand letter (under the warranty?) could be in order but any 
pre-litigation moves need to be coordinated with Richard Sanders.  Maybe this 
hasn't risen to that level yet, but $12 Million sounds pretty serious.

A few more details ................   Again, most of the EGA companies' ownership trail includes all Enron ownership through a number of Enron entities.  Through further research, we found a few more that don't totally fit that mold:
 
Elektro - Electricidad e Servicos S.A. in Brazil  .... 38% of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by Enron entities.
EPE - Empresa Productora de Energia Ltda in Brazil has outside owners including Shell and LJM Brazilco and Interjuris S/C Ltda. a.k.a. Shell Cuiaba Holdings owns two shares and has a 1% direct ownership interest and one Board vote.
Energia Ltd, another Brazil operation, is owned by ENBRAS which in turn in owned by Enron Corp.   (Shares of the company are pledged to Westdeusche Landesbank Gironzentrale as of 22 Feb. 01.
 
Again, this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know.

Steve:
 
As stated earlier, many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership.
 
We can assure you that, for the most part, you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket (i.e., Corp., ENA, EES, etc.).  There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:
 
EA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)
                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)
 
EBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)
 
EEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.
                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  
 
EES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity
                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies
 
EGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with 
                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have
                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.
                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:
                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA
                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)
                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity
                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.
 
EIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM 
                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited
                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)
 
ENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company
 
EWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the 
                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; 
                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.
 
GLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.
 EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership
                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      
                    
Again, I hope this information is helpful.  For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track.  Let my group know if we can be of additional assistance.

  Bob Fisher

Welcome to the Enron WTO Working Group.  We hold our first meeting in Houston 
the evening of Thursday, January 13 at dinner (7:00 PM; restaurant, t/b/a) 
during which Bob Fisher of (Carla) Hills and Company and I will brief 
attendees on current developments and strategy of the Energy Services 
Coalition.

The official Enron WTO Working Group meeting will convene in the Enron 
Building, Conference Room 49C1 on Friday, January 14, 2000 at 8:00 AM-Noon.  
Your input on the attached questionnaire* will be used by the Energy Services 
Coalition (ESC) to draft a position paper for official use.  This 
questionnaire, drafted by Bob Fisher, has already been distributed to members 
of the Energy Services Coalition (ESC) and to many of you.

We also need your input on businesses and associations known to you whom you 
might contact.  We would like you to enlist their support for our goals with 
either our government or others who are able to influence the WTO services 
negotiation.  

We plan to use the Enron Conference Call System on Friday to facilitate the 
participation of those unable to be in Houston for the January 14, 2000 
meeting.  The meeting will adjourn before noon.

Kindly advise Lora Sullivan by e-mail (lsulliv@enron.com) if you plan to be 
with us for the Thursday dinner (7:00 PM) and the Friday session (8:00 AM - 
Noon).

Best wishes for a pleasant holiday.

Joe Hillings

Encl.

*Please complete the questionnaire and forward to Joe Hillings prior to

Chris, we are not going to be able to repair this problem in the next few
days.  We need to do some programming work.  If you guys would go ahead and
pay the bill, it'll be washed out in an adjustment hopefully next month.
The bill itself is correct, it's just on the wrong contract.
Let me know if this is ok with you.   Thanks, ii

The following is the understanding I have with Chris Calger regarding Scott 
Healy's involvement in East Power initiatives:

Since Auburndale is effectively dead, Scott will no longer be involved on 
this project.
Scott will support the Haywood, Georgia, & Calvert City development site 
sales through Q1 2001, with East Power getting 100% of the P&L value and 
Scott Healy getting personal performance credit.   If Ben elects to continue 
to use Scott's services beyond Q1 2001, a value sharing agreement between 
Ben, Calger and myself will have to be agreed upon.
Jeff Ader will make a decision (after consultation with me) as to Scott's 
continued involvement on the fuel cell tax monetization and Dighton 
restructuring project.   If Jeff makes the decision that Scott needs to 
remain actively involved in order to close the transaction, a value sharing 
agreement will be made between Jeff, Calger, and myself.    The value 
allocation % will be agreed upon upfront within the next week.   If a fair 
value sharing agreement cannot be reached, Jeff will transition 
responsibility to another member of his origination team.

Chris - Do you agree with the above description? "

When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have 
focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge.  We have stayed away 
from transmission issues on the assumption that California, with its ISO and 
PX, does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the 
country.  Is this true?  Does California's system layer in priorities for 
utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control ""path 15""?  Does that 
control provide advantageous access to PG&E?  Are there other examples and 
are there links between these ""preferences"" and the current problems in 
California?  As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns 
into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us."

The Brazilian arbitration statute is only four years old, so arbitration is 
still somewhat of a new concept.  However, businesspeople in the more 
sophisticated commercial centers (Sao Paulo and Rio) are comfortable with it, 
as are those companies that have been involved in international projects, are 
subsidiaries of multi-national companies, or that have relied on offshore 
financing.  Governmental and quasi-governmental entities, including 
utilities, have been resistant to it, in part because there is language in 
the Brazilian Constituition that could be interpreted to forbid waiving 
resort to the courts where natural resources (""patrimonial rights"") are 
involved.  I think where we will get pushback on this policy is with respect 
to the language of the arbitration and the ICC.  For that reason, I suggest 
we go ahead and ""pre-qualify"" the acceptance of Portugese for contacts where 
less than $5 million is involved, and the acceptance of alternative arbitral 
bodies (the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and perhaps FIESP) where less than 
$3 million is involved.

Michelle, I did not speak with Jim or Rob about this, so I am assuming that 
you did.  I think it is a good policy, although I am still not as convinced 
as Sami is that the courts in Brazil will so cavalierly disregard 
international arbitration provisions. Nevertheless, I think it was necessary 
to change our policy from a commercial perspective; we were getting too much 
resistance to foreign arbitration.  Now the question is, do we go the next 
step and see if Jim will approve submitting to the jurisdiction of some 
courts in Brazil which are generally reliable and free of corruption (e.g., 
Sao Paulo and Rio) if the counterparty rejects arbitration, and the largest 
sum of money that would ever be in dispute would be less than $500,000?  I 
think we will face that soon, so we may as well raise it now.

Effective immediately, trading contracts to be performed in Brazil between a 
Brazilian Enron entity and another Brazilian entity, may contain agreements 
for arbitration in Sao Paulo using the ICC administration and rules, to be 
conducted in the English language as a first choice or English & Portuguese 
as a second choice.  Attached is the rationale for this exception to the 
policy favoring foreign arbitration and a model clause.  Legal will continue 
to monitor how the Brazilian courts react to arbitration both foreign and 
domestic and reevaluate the policy in 2002.  Please call Michelle Blaine if 
you have any questions.

Just wanted to drop you a note to let you know that I will be in the London 
office during the week of January 15.  I will arrive just after lunch on 
Monday and plan to be there through Thursday.  Much of my time will be spent 
with Fernley and Mike Jordan.  

If you have a few minutes while I am in town, it would be great to get with 
you to hear if there is anything that is of particular concern or interest to 
you in supporting the continuing growth of your business in 2001.  I will 
stop by while I am in the office.  --Sally  "

517518 and 517520 have been changed to FPL Energy Power Marketing; and Tom's 
sticking by his price on 517518. Would you mind sending me Jeff Wallace's 
phone number if you have it? These guys are still busy trading, so I'd like 
to take care of it myself if I can.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, same thing on this trade. I think it should be FPL Energy Power 
Marketing b/c I received a confirm on it. Secondly on the confirm it states 
that hour 0100-0600 is priced at $95.00 and then again at hours 2300-2400. 
7-22 is priced at $140. However I do not show in the system 1-6 and 23-24 at 
$95. Did he forget to put in the off peak or is FPL incorrect.

Thanks,

I just wanted to give all of you an update to my previous message on the 
replacement for Brian Heinrich in Financial Operations.  Jennifer Blay was 
going to be his replacement; however, Jennifer has accepted a position in 
Energy Operations working for Jeff Sorenson.  The newest addition to the 
Financial Operations staff is Holly Heath who joins us from Bank United.  She 
is located at EB-2419A and can be reached at Ext. 3-5843.  In addition, Sarah 
Brown will transfer as Manager of the Consolidated Reporting Team from the 
Gas and Transmission Assets Team in the Business Analysis and Reporting 
organization.  Sarah is located at EB-2419B and can be reached at Ext. 3-3417.

Brian will be helping to transition Holly into her new responsibilities.  As 
such, you will be receiving E-mails from Brian during the next week or so.  
After that, Holly will begin to request information directly from you.

Please join me in welcoming both Holly and Sarah into their new roles.  
Thanks for your patience during the next few weeks.  If you have any 
questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Eric,

Counterparty would like to see volume as 910,000/mo rather than 29355/day, 
due to the 5 MMBtu discrepancy our volume causes.  Can you adjust TAGG to the 
per month volume?

Thanks,
Joe

Sara,

Okay, looks to me like Weyerhaueser wants us to act as their counsel.  I told 
Bill to propose the language he wanted, but he said his lawyer was out of 
town for two weeks.  Which makes me wonder if they can even sign this thing 
without her consent, but I did not think to ask him this at the time.

Anyway, he basically wants to add a third party guarantee as eligible credit 
support in the event of a downgrade.  He said he is willing to include 
language indicating that the nondowngraded party would have to accept this 
guarantee, subject to a commercially reasonable objection.  On its face, I 
have no objection to such a provision, but would like to quickly bounce it 
off of you.  I'm not sure that I want to be forced to disclose what that 
reason is....

And basically, I also have no objection to allowing the posting of collateral 
in a form and amount acceptable to the nondowngraded party, with such amount 
subject to change as conditions warrant.

Also, I thought we usually had assignability to affiliates so long as the 
guarantor remained the same.  I think Bill indicated we probably removed that 
because we had it this way with the Canadian subsidiary.  He wants to put it 
back in.  I want it back in as well.

Otherwise, we are increasing the guaranty amounts to $25MM, and they have 
agreed to the cross default provisions.

Let's discuss this when you get a minute.  He had some additional 
clarification he needed, but these seemed to be the legal issues on his 
list.  I don't think there is going to be any way around this other than to 
call him and explain.  Sorry.

Paul

Gloria Barkowsky has access to Escript, but she is on vacation this week. I don't know if someone else in Volume Management has access (Rita??).  

Dominion used to send data files to us that, in addition to ""current"" month allocations and meter statements, may have included imbalance information.

Subject:	Dominion Imbalance statements

Kathryn (EES Volume Management) and I are trying to determine what the Dominion Pipeline imbalances are from the Appalachian producers  for EES.  Dominion will not tell us without making a formal request to their legal department.  We may have to do that anyway.  I'm not sure what this report is called, I just know its on a 2 month lag.  I'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of Escript (Dominion's EBB).  If it was run out of Escript, then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me.  If the report was mailed to us, then I'll have to make a formal request to Dominion's legal department.

Don't spend more than 10 minutes trying to figure out how to do this.  If the person that handled Dominion is gone, then I'll just go the ""legal"" route.

Thanks

  Some cute bumper stickers!

  Some people are only alive because
  it is illegal to shoot them

  I used to have a handle on life, but it broke.

  WANTED: Meaningful overnight relationship.

  You're just jealous because the voices
  only talk to ME.

  BEER: It's not just for breakfast anymore.

  So you're a feminist...Isn't that cute.

  I need someone real bad...
  Are you real bad?

  BEAUTY is in the eye of the beer holder.

  All men are idiots...
  and I married their king.

  The more you complain,
  the longer God makes you live.

  I(nternal) R(evenue) S(ervice):
  We've got what it takes
  to take what you've got.

  Hard work has a future payoff.
  Laziness pays off now.

  Reality is a crutch for people
  who can't handle drugs.

  Out of my mind...Back in five minutes.

  As long as there are tests,
  there will be prayer in public schools.

  Hang up and drive.

  I said ""NO"" to drugs,
  but they didn't listen.

  Your kid may be an Honor Student,
  but YOU'RE still an idiot.

  Smile, it's the second best thing you can do with your lips.

  I took an IQ test and the results were negative.

  Where there's a will...I want to be in it.

  It's lonely at the top, but you eat better.

  Don't drink and drive...
  You might hit a bump and spill your drink.

  Consciousness: That annoying time between naps.

  Ever stop to think, and forget to start again?

  Always remember you're unique...
  Just like everyone else.

  HONK
  If You Want To See My Finger

  Who lit the fuse on your tampon?

  I don't have a license to kill.
  I have a learner's permit.

  I wasn't born a bitch.
  Men like you made me this way.

  Keep honking while I reload.

  Taxation WITH representation isn't so hot, either!

  Who were the testers for
  Preparations A through G?

  Madness takes its toll.
  Please have exact change.

  5 days a week my body is a temple.
    The other two, it's an amusement park.

  EARTH FIRST!
  We'll stripmine the other planets later.

  If you drink, don't park.
  Accidents cause people.

  If you can read this
  I can hit my brakes and sue you.

  Save the whales!
  Trade them for valuable prizes.

  Whitewater is over
  when the First Lady sings.

  Jack Kevorkian for White House physician.

  My wife keeps complaining I never listen to her
  ...or something like that.

  Sure you can trust the government!
  Just ask an Indian!

  Alcohol and calculus don't mix.
  Never drink and derive.

  If we are what we eat,
  I'm cheap, fast, and easy.

  Stop repeat offenders.
  Don't re-elect them!

I bought 15,000/d at the TCO Pool from Dick J at $6.895 for 12/2 through 
12/31. At first he was concerned we were swinging on ENA and not storage and 
I assured him you folks knew what volume we buy/sell @ GD as soon as you get 
my nom. I have even included my estimate on the bottom of my daily nom sheet.

Steve, 

How are things going with this request?

FYI.  The majority of deals we transact on Oasis are done as HPLC.  Only 
sales to LCRA and term sales to Tufco are done as ENA.

Thanks.

Please forward this to whoever in the Pipeline group does transport,

Dan, 

ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines 
(listed below).  Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the 
majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to 
HPL.  Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.  What is the process 
used to accomlish this?  We would like to get this set up as soon as we can.

Thanks.

Another Tino-gram.  DOE disclosed to Team Tino that they pay a $7.06/mo 
demand charge per KW in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge.  Tino didn't 
know whether that was per KW of monthly demand, per KW of non-coincident peak 
usage, or what.  The PNM tariff for govt. service is priced at $7.16/KW of 
""demand above 10,000kw during peak period""  (peak period is daytime) so I 
assume that is how it is calculated.  If that is the tariff (""Schedule 
4000B"") under which DOE really takes service, this is interesting because 
that is not a very big discount off of the stated rate.  It is also 
interesting that DOE is paying $.053/kwh for energy since the Schedule 4000B 
energy rate is $.05072/kwh (maybe the difference is surcharges or something). 
Tino's consultant has figured out that the demand charge equates to an 
incremental $.011 in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge, for a total 
delivered PNM rate to DOE of $.064/kwh.  This is not as good as the 7 cent 
number Tino threw around earlier in the week, but its still not terrible.  If 
the bogey is a 10% reduction to the current rate, our number to beat is 
$.0576/kwh.  Tino promised us copies of DOE's actual energy bills to confirm 
these numbers.  That would be great and solves the due diligence problem you 
and I talked about yesterday, Kevin.    

Tino also passed along a rumor he heard from the Isleta's consultant that the 
Cobisa Belen project is dead.  Do we know anything about this???  
Interesting.  I'm waiting to hear back from Bill Votaw to line up a due 
diligence call to Tino's government contracts lawyers in DC to confirm 
whether the ""sole source"" strategy is legit.  Kevin, I'll let you know when 
this is scheduled in case you want to be on the call.  Thanks.  DF "

Knox thinks any settlement will be between 1-2 million,probably closer to 2. What business person, if any, should we talk to about this? With Carrin, Neal M. and Knox, the attys fees will be enormous if this case ever gets going again.

I had lunch with Ronnie Krist and he will settle if the money gets right.
He said it should be easier with no class, to work something out  since he
now has a case with only 87 plaintiffs.  Our earlier offer of I believe
$400,000 won't do it.  It will probably take more than $1,000,000 in an
offer to get a real number from Ronnie.  He also observed that it will be
interesting to see what happens to the make up of the Supreme Court.

At the suggestion of Tim B. we are going to implement a procedure for Middle 
Market Transcation Deal Entry and Confirmation.  I will be writing this 
procedure.  There have been some confirms sent out recently that were 
inaccurate and some other EnPower entry issues.  More importantly, however, 
Tim simply wants to tighten procedures as a risk control mechanism.  He also 
will be writing procedures for other things various folks in his group do. 
These procedures will be put into a West Trading Procedure Book that is being 
created.  To get this process started (prior to my writing it up), please 
immediately start doing the following:

1.  On every future trade you do, tell the trader taking the position (i.e LT 
NW, ST CA, etc.) that you should be identified as the trader.  By doing this, 
you will be responsible for making sure the deal is confirmed properly.  
Otherwise, they are responsible for the accuracy of the Confirm.  
2.  I will be sent a copy of all MM group confirms from Houston and will be 
putting them into a Master MM Confirms notebook.  When received, I will 
indicate to you that it is here and you will be responsible for checking it 
and making sure it is accurate.  An accurate confirm generally means the deal 
was entered correctly into EnPower.
3.  For all existing deals that you think should be included in this notebook 
because they are a little hairy and you want to make sure your hands are 
clean with respect to an accurate confirm, please make sure I get a copy as 
soon as possible.

Thanks

Chris

Rice recruiting team,

As some of you are aware, Enron is sponsoring  sell weekends (Dec 1 and Dec 
8) for all the candidates that have received offers.  The Rice team is 
organizing a dinner for the Jones School candidates this Friday evening (Dec. 
1) at Tony Ruppe's.  I am looking for 5 to 8 Enron Jones School recruiters to 
attend the dinner on Friday.  

Please let me know if you will be able to attend.

Thanks,
Jaime

Even though we have changed the reimbursement from 50 / 50 on both
interconnects
to each entity paying 100% of one interconnect I still feel the language
requiring either party to reimburse the other if operational circumstances
constrain the physical intent of the interconnect is still needed.  In this
way
both entities will be aligned in trying to insure both the receipt and
delivery
interconnects function as intended.  Please let me know if you disagree.

Shelley,

Mid-La schedules all of their gas at the Port Allen point but they may split their takes during the day across Port Hudson, Port Allen, and/or E. Baton Rouge. All 3 points are in the same area and combined under the OBA ofr a net imbalance.

Thanks,  Tim

Tim,

Is the activity at the MidLouisiana points normal.  How did we build up a 156,000 MMBtu balance at Port Hudson.  Is this a measurement or a scheduling mismatch?  How big is this point?

Good Morning All!

I have made a mistake; I thought I sent a notice last week that Cheryl was planning to be out this Monday.  FYI, she will be out for the entire day and will return to the office at her regular time, tomorrow.  I apologize for any inconvenience my oversight may have caused.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I would like to see us try to re-insert words to the effect that if the 
Commission throws out the CSA after haranguing the parties to reach an 
agreement, it will seriously discourage future settlement efforts by parties. 
That is not a deal-breaker for me, just a suggestion. Otherwise the comments 
are fine.

would expect.? They also eliminate the lengthy recitation of the procedural 
events at the end of the letter.? If this gets them on the letter, I say

Please finalize the attached NDA so that we can send to the UK for execution 
as soon as possible.  When we've received an executed copy, we can send to 
Robert Harris at the number set forth below.  (If you have a better process 
in place, go for it.)  We just need to make sure we have a final signed NDA

When we have received an executed copy from Credit 2B, please be sure to let

Human Resources Manager

Dear Ms. Magee:
 
It was a great pleasure to meet you at the NSHMBA Career Fair in San Antonio, Texas and to learn more about employment opportunities at Enron. Our conversation reinforced my desire to join Enron's Associate Program. I am positive that my strong analytical skills, specific knowledge of industry regulation and working experience overseas, particularly in the energy sector would be great assets to your organization. 
 
As I mentioned to you during the conference, through my career and during my MBA studies at the Simon School (University of Rochester) and the London School of Economics (LSE), where I earned a MS in Industry Regulation, I have gained strong analytical skills and an excellent understanding of the global trends in the energy sector, especially of those related to the deregulation of the industry. Furthermore, working as an economist at the Vice-Ministry of the Treasury in Bolivia allowed me to gain hands-on experience in quantitative and financial analysis. These experiences have been complemented by my recent summer internship with British Petroleum (BP) Latin America where I was responsible for developing a valuation model to determine the acquisition price of a liquefied petroleum gas distributing company. As a result, I was directly exposed to the extraordinary prospects of the energy sector and to the expectations and needs of energy companies. 
 
My current studies at the Simon School have also helped me further develop my finance and communication skills, which are essential for a position with Enron. I am confident I will be able to contribute positively to your organizations success. I would appreciate the opportunity to further discuss how my professional qualifications and personal qualities fit Enron present activities and its plans for the future. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any specific related to my credentials, please do not hesitate to contact me to the following telephone number: (716) 271 0934.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Marcos A. Tapia

Laura,
Based on the response received from Sue and TK (below), please remind PNM of the 10,000 Dth PNR balance and ask them to nominate the gas off TW at their earliest convenience. The gas is currently ""parked"" at the Rio Puerco PNR point, POI# 500617. Since the Purchase Order# 27190 expired on 4/30/2000, PNM will have to use their current PNR contract (Cr# 27267).  I have asked Richard Hanagriff to transfer the quantities from PO# 27190 to Cr# 27267. 

In your discussions with PNM you might verify that Imbalance Statements should continue to be sent to Sally Prentice at Alvarado Square in Albuquerque, NM. (TW has been sending an imbalance statement on this 10,000 Dth to Sally each month)  

If you have any questions, please call me.

I agree with Sue.  I don't think they would pay up to this point.  Just have PNM get it out.

I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenient for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again?

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?

Enron debt sinks on credit crunch fears


By Nancy Leinfuss 

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Bonds of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ene&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>), which is trying to curb fears that it faces a credit crunch, fell sharply on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported the energy giant on Thursday drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and is in talks with its banks about obtaining a new multibillion dollar credit line.

	

Houston-based Enron's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said late on Thursday that the company, the largest U.S. energy trader with $67.3 billion of assets, had drawn down from its credit lines to obtain more than $1 billion in cash to alleviate concerns about its liquidity. 

``There's been a lot of downward pressure on Enron following the negative news,'' said an investment-grade bond trader. ``Investment-grade accounts have been trying to exit those bonds, but there hasn't been any support from either high-yield or hedge funds.'' 

Enron did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 

Enron's investment-grade 6.40 percent notes due in 2006, which just two weeks ago were quoted to yield 2.3 percentage points more than five-year U.S. Treasuries, are now quoted at a dollar price, like junk bonds. They were bid Friday at 80 cents on the dollar, with a yield to maturity of 12.09 percent, or 8.34 percentage points more than Treasuries. 

Enron's 8.31 percent issue due 2003 fell a similar amount on Friday, and also trades at 80 cents on the dollar, traders said. 

The company's stock, meanwhile, has lost more than half of its value in the last two weeks as investors began questioning off-the-balance-sheet transactions between the company and two limited partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking at those transactions for possible conflicts of interest. 

Enron ousted Fastow on Wednesday. 

The shares were down $1.09, or 6.7 percent, at $15.26 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade. 

CREDIT RATINGS AT RISK 

On Thursday, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's revised Enron's outlook to negative while affirming its long- and short-term credit ratings of ``BBB-plus'' and ``A-2.'' 

S&P said it is closely monitoring Enron's capital needs and liquidity position, which it considers crucial to the success of the company's core business operations. 

``Assurances from the top levels of Enron management that the company will maintain its commitment to its credit quality and that no steps are being taken to support the company's common stock price at the expense of credit quality provide further support for Enron's ratings,'' S&P said. 

S&P said it revised its outlook after the big drop in Enron's market capitalization this week, which it said has hurt the company's financial flexibility and may impede management's ability to rebuild the balance sheet and sell assets in a timely manner. 

``The negative outlook acknowledges the potential for erosion of the company's credit quality as investor confidence in the company's management has waned,'' S&P said. 

Another credit rating agency, Fitch, on Thursday warned it may downgrade Enron's debt, saying the erosion of consumer confidence could block the company's access to capital markets.

I informed Dr. Boyce that we would not be able to sell the Guam plant until we resolved Enron's default under the ABN Amro loan to that facility.  Of course, we will contact him when the sales process is resumed.

Clement,

Brent Hendry has been working on an Enron Corp Guaranty, which would guarantee the physical and financial trading obligations of various Enron affiliates with that of various Duke affiliates.

Attached for your review are Duke's comments to the proposed Guaranty.  For your viewing convenience, the attached document has been prepared in a ""redlined"" format, which tracks Duke's changes in a red font.    Please note, ENA has upgraded its form of Guaranty and those changes appear in a red boldfaced font.

Please let me know which changes you will or will not approve.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Dear all,

If you recall, several months ago we held a meeting to discuss the bonus 
planning needs for Commercial and Commercial Support Analysts now that they 
have been combined into one program under the A/A Program umbrella.

I was asked to put together some information on how bonuses in 1999 compared 
between Merchant Service Analysts, Commercial Analysts and Commercial Support 
Sr. Specialists (and possibly even Managers) so that we could determine if 
there would be a 2000 bonus compression problem in Analysts being placed in 
Commercial Support positions and then having lower bonuses.  Attached below 
you will find the results of that research.

In short the conclusions are these:
The 2000 system allows a difference between Commercial and Commercial Support 
Analyst bonus matrices preventing the compression problem.
In 1999, Commercial Analyst and Commercial Support Sr. Specialist bonus 
matrices were comparable - and this can still occur in 2000.
Bonus structures can easily be planned for 2000 so that no compression 
problem occurs.



The data above is being sent to help you understand the concepts we discussed 
and put closure to the meeting.  The 2000 bonus planning system allows for a 
variation within Analyst categories (commercial and commercial support) and 
will meet the business needs.  Please let me know if you want to discuss 
further or would like to see the raw data used in the research.

Regards,
Kim"

I attach the new draft of the Agency Agreement I received from Peoples a few 
moments ago.

Simon Helfrich called to comment on the credit provisions.  The essence of 
their proposal is that the LLC acts as a guarantor of all accounts receivable 
from parties for whom the LLC has performed the credit check.

I look forward to discussing this draft with you.

Thanks!  DT

Below is a copy of the Order lifting the $250/Mwh hard price cap for 
California ISO/PX.
FERC has also posted a notice of a  Dec. 15 special mtg. re the investigation 
into the California market last summer.
Various Enron units continue to receive informal data requests from FERC 
staff regarding current California gas/electric 
Steve Kean has asked that all inquiries be coordinated through Sarah Novosel 
in the DC office.
Leslie Lawner is preparing Enron's response to the SDG&E emergency petition 
to put a cap on gas sales.
 





              COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA 
                            ELECTRICITY MARKETS

          In response to emergency conditions that exist in the
     California electricity markets, which have faced supply shortages
     and snowballing prices, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
     today approved a price cap change requested by the California
     Independent System Operator (ISO).   The Commission also took
     steps to permit qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full
     capacity.

          The ISO's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted. 
     Bids above that amount will be allowed but will not set the
     clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase
     price cap.  This should attract more bids and alleviate chronic
     supply shortages.  
          
          Those bidding above $250 will be required to report their
     bids to the Commission on a weekly basis and provide certain cost
     information.  

          The non-profit ISO and PX began operations in California in
     1998.  The PX is the scheduling coordinator for the IOUs as well
     as other market participants.   The ISO operates and controls
     most of the transmission system in California.

          In addition to the $250 purchase price cap, the Commission
     also authorized the ISO to penalize participating generators that
     refuse to operate in response to an ISO request in an emergency.  
     They will be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price
     the ISO paid for energy for each hour in which the participating
     generator failed to respond.   

          The ISO's costs of obtaining energy through bids above the
     purchase price cap or through out-of-market dispatches will be
     assigned to scheduling coordinators who depend too much on spot
     markets.

          The Commission's second order enables QF entities to
     generate at full capacity which in the past could have caused
     them to lose QF status.  QF generators are small power producers
     that use alternative fuels, such as solar or biomass, and
     cogenerators that produce both electricity and steam for
     commercial use.   

          The order on QF entities was in response to a request from a
     California QF.

          The orders are effective immediately.

Folks:
Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.

They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding ""spot market service"" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as ""an option to elect.""  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a ""backstop,"" in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.

Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any ""stakes in the ground"" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.

In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., ""what to do about DA in the interm?""  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.

Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.

Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).

Best,
Jeff

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Shame on you,




Rob Serenbetz"

Hey-- 

Well, as far as I know, the phone number works! :-)  Talking next week would be fine. I'll be back in Philly as of Sun evening. ie: EST, 2 hours ahead of Denver :-) 

I'm not sure if I should be offering my congratulations or not, you failed to mention whether you were one of the 3 who made the final cut... regardless, you sound like you're hanging in there. 

I'm sitting in the airport, on my way home and thrilled to be doing so. 

Talk to you later!

Hey,

Thanks for the phone number, I hope it works! It's a little crazy for me this weekend also. Why don't I call you during the first part of next week and see if we can set something up. What time zone will you be in?

As far as the job goes, three in this office made the final cut. So we are waiting around for our next set of orders. I'll explain more later. Take care.

Paul

Kate,

If you would you, please start to draft a letter to the vendors for the 
solicitation of the raffle gifts?  We will probably need two letters, one to 
thank the vendor for their participation last year (I have the list of 
donated items) and another for new vendors that we will be soliciting.  

Here are a few points we need to make:

Thanks for particpating last year
Name the charity(s), a worthy cause type thing
State they are a current vendor in our system
The vendor name will be announced at the party, good advertising
Attach the article from last year

There may be more, but that is what comes to mind right now.  Since we will 
be using the merge feature we can insert the name of the vendor in the body 
of the letter.

Thanks!

Mollie"

Nick,

The airport is about 30 minutes  by cab from the office (1400 Smith).
The best hotel is either Hyatt Regency Downtown or Doubletree 
Downtown (it is important to emphasize Downtown when making
reservations). The hotels are within a walking distance
from  the Enron building.

We can make reservations  for dinner around 6:30 - 7:00
in a resturant  within 10 minutes by car from the hotel.

By the way, we shall be very glad to reimburse you for the trip related 
expenses.

Vince,

Yes, that would be ideal. But let me call first my travel agent to
see if there is a flight that would satisfy all the other
constraints. What time should I be at Enron on Thursday, and how far is
the airport from your offices?

Thanks,

Nick

Tom/Sally,
The Financial and Power Confirmation team performed testing this morning as well as this afternoon on the ConfirmLogic module.  Testing went extremely well in both cases.  We feel very comfortable with the functionality and display of information contained within the module.  All of our major issues have been resolved.  Therefore, I am comfortable giving my approval that ConfirmLogic is ready for release to the Beta Customers for testing.  Below is a comprehensive list of the current business parameters as well as the business issues to be discussed and resolved during Beta testing.

Subject:	ConfirmLogic Certification


Dear Kim:

The CommodityLogic team presents ConfirmLogic to Enron for the beta program, which Enron will be a key participant. The following are the current parameters for how the system will perform during this program.

Negative Confirmation
?If deal status is 'Pending' and current date is 3 business days past the post date; ConfirmLogic changes deal status from 'Pending' to 'Confirmed'. 


Updating Existing Deals
?No restrictions on updates - counterparties can send deal changes at any time for any deal.

	
Viewing Confirmed Deals
?ConfirmLogic allows view-only capability to deals that have been confirmed (user cannot post inquiry or add deal number).

Deal Types Offered
?ConfirmLogic will be offering the following deal types:  
Financial Natural Gas: Swaps, Gas Daily Swap, Options, Gas Daily Options Swaptions
Financial Power: Swaps, Options, Swaptions
Physical Power: Forwards, Index Forwards, Options, Swaption 

During the beta program the following open issues related to the system functionality will be discussed with our beta clients in order to establish an industry standard.  The goal will be to modify the system with the final business rules for the commercial release.  Enron will participate in the discussion and decision making process during the program.

Negative Confirmation
?Mirror industry standard and apply same rule for all deal types.
	
Expiration of Inquired Deals
?Expire inquired deals when no actions have been taken for a defined period of time.


Updating Existing Deals  
?Allow updates and develop method for defining intent of information published to CommodityLogic.


Agreement on Other Terms
?Assumed agreement for terms not presented in ConfirmLogic in place between counterparties before committing to use module.





Regards, 
Kathryn Cordes, ModuleManager ConfirmLogic

Hey Guys,


I do not feel that the Heartland Steel/CSN issue is resolved.  We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001.  If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel?  Have we been paid by Heartland Steel?  Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom?  Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel?

While the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty.

Will you please let me know how we should proceed.  I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an Enron representative.

Let me know what the game plan is by noon, Friday, September 28, 2001.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Doug...thanks for the hospitality last Tuesday night at Pheasant Run...I
enjoyed hanging out with you and Mike.

On our conversation about trading around MAPP...our assets in the Chicago
area are in an excellent position to be accessible to MidAmerican and
Alliant, and if you'd like to have your spot traders start calling us on
our real-time desk at 800.848.3975 we'd welcome the calls.  Although I
think you may find some reluctance on your side to get done with us,
clearly we can supply odd lots and load-following schedules into MAPP...and
hopefully that gets us some leverage.  If you're willing to undertake
payables to us we're more than happy to accept them.

Thanks again.

Dear Officers,

Hines, the building management team, has offered to move us at no charge to
space on the 36th floor of our building.  The move itself will cost Hines an
estimated $87,000 -- for construction of the space, moving fees,
telecommunications setup and office materials.  Our lease for this new space
would run through May 2002 at our current rate.

They will give us the option to now sign a lease extension from May 2002 to
May 2005 at a base rate of no more than $20.50 per square foot.  We have
checked with several corporate real estate facilities departments (Enron, El
Paso, Dynegy) with the general consensus reached that this is clearly a
financial advantage for us.

Should we not take this offer,  Cinergy will assume our space at the end of
our lease.  We will be responsible for our own move (a considerable expense),
and after the move will be responsible for a higher lease rate, assuming we
stay in the downtown Houston area.  In the meantime, we will be placed in the
middle of Cinergy's construction on our floor.

All things considered, I advise that we do agree to the move, which can be
accomplished over a weekend with little disruption to our office.    Please
let me know if you concur or have concerns.

Best Regards,  Rae

would consider moving.  Cinergy -- the only other tenant on our floor, have
asked for our space.  Our lease runs through to April 2002, for 2455 square
feet of space.  Hines noted that all moving expenses (upwards of $50,000)
would be covered.  In addition, they indicated our lease might be extended to
the end of 2004 at our current rate of $6.00 base per square foot and $8.50
add on for utilities and maintenance per square foot, for a total of $14.50
per square foot.  This is an advantageous rate as it was negotiated prior to
downtown becoming so populated.  We confirmed with commercial real estate
agents that average rates for downtown space ""A Buildings"" now are
considerably higher, in the neighborhood of $22 to $30 per square foot and
more if we were located in the Galleria area.  Our building is considered an
""A Building.""

    There is other space in the building that is better laid out, and would
accommodate expansion, if needed.  We are still in the discussion stages --
but it looks like a financially favorable arrangement if everything can be
worked out.  We would be able to move over a weekend, have little or no
disruption of service, maintain the same phone numbers, still be in the same
building -- have more possibilities for expansion if needed, and maintain the
same low rate for a longer period of time.  The space they have offered is
2500 square feet but at our current monthly rental rates.

    We should be able to sublease the space with little difficulty, in the
event a new organization comes into being and our location and office is not
appropriate for the new organization.  Looks like lots of advantages and very
few risks.

    If we stay where we are, our lease runs out in April 2002 in which event
we will probably be required to move and we will spend upwards of $50,000 to
make such a move and be faced with higher per square foot rental costs.
Meanwhile, Cinergy is planning to reconstruct our floor and our office will
be in the middle of construction activity for some time.

    The conversations are in the early stages, and I'll keep you informed as
they go. Let me know if you have any concerns with  this approach.

Best Regards,  Rae"

Mike:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even sure that the Commission can successfully ""regulate"" prices in the secondary market.)
 
Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.  
 
But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them.  
 
That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.  Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised?
 
Best,
Jeff

 <<X28621.DOC>>

Enclosed for your review are the draft comments on the Revised Proposed
Decision in the Gas Restructuring Investigation.  WGSI and Enron have
indicated a desire to file supportive comments.  Edison has indicated an
interest in reviewing our draft for the purpose of considering joining in
our comments.  Please send edited electronic versions with underline and
strikeout to MBD at this address no later than noon tomorrow. These comments
must be filed tomorrow before 5 pm.  I am sorry for the lateness of the
draft, but these are not extensive comments.  Except for the little
bombshell about extending commission jurisdiction over gas marketers, I see
little in the RPD to warrant our opposition.  Even if the Commission
proceeds with the jurisdictional grab, I believe it can be overturned by the
Court of Appeals.

I look forward to your comments.

Mike Day

Sara,

    I have amended the agreement.  I don't see the details of Annex A, but I 
usually don't check that over
anyway.

Thanks,

I think it would be great if you could attend on both dates.  However, the 
more important of the two would be March 6 as that would allow you to hear 
the students interview and assess their skills.

There is a slim chance that Mike could attend the event in April.  Jody Crook 
plans on attending that event, too.  I will be at both events, so there will 
be an Enron face at both events.

Please let me know if you will be available.

Thank you,

Lexi

Mike and Sally:

I have been in contact with Ted Jacobs and have volunteered $1500 in 
scholarship funds to be awarded by Enron this spring.  By volunteering this 
money, we are now able to attend scholarship interviews on Tuesday, March 6 
on campus.  This will provide us with the opportunity to target candidates 
for next fall and lay the groundwork for a more competitive future.

After we have identified our scholarship recipients, we are invited to 
present our awards at the Scholarship Awards Banquet on Friday, April 20.  

Ted will (if he has not already) approach you, Mike, to see if you are 
interested in playing a role at this event.   If you are available to attend, 
please let me know.  I plan to have at least 2 Enron representatives at the 
event.

I just wanted to give each of you these details to keep you fully informed of 
our efforts on campus.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please let 
me know.


Thank you,

lexi

Dot,

I'm so glad you know what the problem is.  My brother had a similar micro-surgery last year.  He went home on the same day and was only off work for a couple of days.  Will you be able to start a rehab program/routine after surgery?  Is your doctor comfortable with you traveling to Italy this fall or will it be a wait and see situation to see how you are doing post surgery?  Keep me posted.  Thanks, Kim.

	Kim--

	Got the news today -- good news is we now know what the problem is & it can be fixed.  I have a protruding disc between L5 and S1 that is ""impinging 
	upon the nerve root for L5"" -- i.e., causing the numbness in my left leg and foot.  Bad news is -- surgery is the fix.  However, the neurologist says that 
	recovery from the surgery is pretty short, in light of the micro-surgery they now do on this.  Trying to get in to see the surgeon now, to see how soon 
	I can schedule something.  Keep you informed...

	Kim --

	Thanks for the note -- I had a cat scan yesterday, along with more hip x-rays.  Tomorrow, I have something called an EMG -- ""electro-myogram"" -- sounds 
	similar to the old ""myleograms"", so I just assumed it would be similar -- dye into the spinal cord & take pictures.  However, Staci looked it up on the 
	Internet for me and reported that it is a series of needle probes into various muscles to check for nerve problems, and is somewhat painful -- just what I want 
	at this point!   Surely doesn't sound too great...  oh well, still hope to find something out by tomorrow around noon...
	
	I did hear from a friend of mine, who had something similar a few years ago; she opted for some injections into her back, which worked, so that would be 
	better than surgery or continuing like this, at least. The neurologist did say last week that it is not necessarily my back (altho' that is the most likely 
	cause of this) but said that it could be something in my hip...  So, maybe I'll have a number of options, like physical therapy, injections, etc. and not just 
	surgery.

Dot,

Please keep me posted on your tests.  Also, don't forget to tell the doctors that you just need the really BIG shot now so that you will be ready for Italy in the fall.  Don't over-do it!  I does take time for the back to heal.  

I had lunch with Sue Neville yesterday and she had some great advise for the Amalfi Coast(she and her family just returned from Italy).  On one of the islands near the Amalfi Coast, there are plenty of ""natural spa's"" with salt water, fresh water, hot, cold, dry and wet saunas.  Sounds like a good stop and may even be helpful to your current condition.

Stay flat!

Kim.

	Update -- went to see neurologist on Friday (only got in that early because I practically yelled at a number of people for several hours on Thursday -- I guess they think people can afford to wait 6 weeks to see if they feel any better!  They were willing to set me up with an appointment in Sept., can you imagine???).  

	Anyway, the neurologist knew what nerve is pinched but not where it is getting pinched, where the problem is coming from -- could be my back or my hip.  Having x-rays and cat scan on Monday pm, with something called EMG on Wed.  Let you know what I learn.

Attached is the Gulf South OBA with the following changes (in blue):

	1.  Daily tolerance changed from 50,000 to 100,000 Dth.
	2.  Suspension language stricken.
	3.  Language added to allow daily balancing at other points.
	4.  ""No change to system"" language made mutual.

Since we want to allow the use of other points to balance on a daily basis, do we want one OBA for all ""Locations""?  If not, is the interconnect with the Gulf South Mobile Bay Faciliites the lonly ""Location"" to be covered by this agreement?  Finally, do we want to allow end of the month balancing at other points too?

Hope each of you had a Merry Christmas and enjoyed your time off........

Here is response from Joe at Calpine. In addition to his memo, we also need
to verify intra-day nomination procedures with PGT in the event of force
majeure type interruptions at points other than Malin. Since we cannot give
force majeure protection at Alternate Points of Delivery, they need to
understand scheduling flexibility in the event a nomination needs to be
redirected to Malin.

Joe also asked for more information on the ""renewal"" process on ANG and
NOVA. Peter/Eric: we will need your assistance. Does any information
pertaining to this reside in their tariffs?

Please look at this first thing in the am. We are going for signatures on
Wednesday!

Regards

Below are the main features of the Sponsorship contract drafted by World 
Advisory Today (WAT) to be executed with Enron.
1.- Enron must pay Mexican pesos 100,000 plus VAT
2.- Enron will obtain:
2 banners (one in the main conference room, another in the dinning room)
presence in the attendants' folders, in the conference program, in the 
conference's diskette sheath and in the advertisement conference posters.
2 tickets
3.- WAT will decide where to install and the exact print of Enron's 
Industrial Property (what we wish to publish an advertise in the conference, 
I assume it is our logo).
4.- WAT is bound to protect Enron's Industrial Property
5.- The contract will expire on August 8, 2001 (last day of the conference). 
Perhaps we should claim to include the word ""inclusive"" after the expiration 
day.
6.- (clause or term invalidity); 7.- (waiver & force major); 8.- 
(notifications); and 9.- (rights transfer forbidden) are formal sections, 
usual in many contracts. I do not find anything unfair in them; however, I do 
not know if they are acceptable to our attorneys.
10.- The contract will be interpreted according to Mexican Laws. In case of 
conflict, parties will be subject to Mexico City Justice.
I doubt our lawyers accept to be subject to other country's Justice (unless 
there is an exemption due to the small contract amount).

Please let me know if you want a further analysis

Warren Tashnek called to say that the documents for the credit line will not 
be available until next week.  It seems that all of Soc Gen's Paris office is 
on holiday for the month of August so the  credit proposal for the Enron 
facility is gathering dust on someone's desk until they return.  

Mary Cook is working on t he brokerage agreement between Fimat and Enron.  
That should be done in about a week.

Create Limit Order 
Clicking Submit in the Create Limit Order panel creates an order that will remain in the EnronOnline system until the order is either filled at your specified price or expires after a specified time limit. If, during that time, the price you entered falls between the Enron's  Bid and Offer posted on EnronOnline, then EnronOnline [m1] will change [m2] its price to show a new market with a tighter spread that reflects your limit order the price at which you are willing to trade with us*.

You can cancel an existing limit order at any time before it is filled by highlighting the order in the Today's Orders screen and clicking Cancel.

*Multiple limit orders for the same price will be prioritized by the time of submission. Only limit orders that are between EnronOnline's Bid and Offer prices will create a new EnronOnline market on the Quotes screen.

Errol,
I noticed a small mistake late last night.  Their is West orig on your Orig 
schedule that is not 0.  It is already on the west schedule so the value just 
needs to be taken off your orig schedule tab.  

The cells that need to be set = to 0 are p41 and q41

Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.  
As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two 
day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be 
discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian 
in Las Vegas.

This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard 
and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage 
everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we 
would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.

ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.

Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.

I want to cancel the wire to Dominion Oklahoma that was set to go out today and I'm going to revise the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant.

The other wires to Reliant, the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00, are good to go.

I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00.
This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 (cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000).

I am requesting the following prepays to Reliant and Dominion for tomorrow.  All of these request are signed and on Doug's desk.

Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline  $40,000.00

Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract
		10,000 dth x 2 days x $3.50 per dth = $70,000.00

Prepay to Dominion Oklahoma for April baseload activity 10,000 dth x 30 days x $2.1562 per dth = $646,860.00

i agree with kay's suggested approach.

if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

                                         deal on Florida





I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

Kay

Harry / Sara

Duke Energy has given us their guaranty language for review.  We are asking 
them to cover a subsidiary that trades physical and financial NGL products.  
I have asked them to use our language to which they refused.  I was told by 
other people in the credit group that Duke only issues guarantees in their 
language.  The credit manager did indicate that he would certainly be open to 
any suggestions we would have to their language.  Can you both look at the 
attached guaranty and let me know if it is acceptable for their issuance or 
if you have comments.

I would really appreciate your help as we have begun selling to them.

Thanks,  Cathy Tudon

Who is your contact at Zargon? We have a discrepency between tagg and the confirm on the term of a deal and I need to talk to the marketing contact to figure out what is correct. We sold them a cal 01 crude put (according to the confirm) but the system has it continuing until feb 02.

 FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that 
vest based upon 60MW of orders;
  - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about 
the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that 
call;
  - the transaction is fully press released immediately.

 CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide 
the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development   
opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;
  - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing 
at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all 
press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory 
filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we 
manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Thanks
Delainey"

The e-mail I sent yesterday has an attachment that installs the new version 
of the database.  It worked well in the four computers we used to test it.  
Nevertheless, it failed on Bob Shults's computer (maybe because of a slightly 
different configuration of his computer).  We rewrote the attachment to fix 
the problem.

If the attachment gave you trouble, or if you have not launched it yet, 
please use the one below instead.

Sorry for the inconvenience,

Jeff - my reply to Teece

David:

I will be pleased to sign and endorse the manifesto.  However, I am
troubled by three points.

First - there is no mention of further deregulation of the market as
regards distributed generation.  I know this hurts the incumbent utilities
- and that may create problems for some members.  However, I think the only
way  to get large consumers to buy in.  Further, it is essential to make
deregulation really work.

Second - the natural gas issue is not mentioned.  Yet natural gas is part
of the problem.

Third - the manifesto is far too long.  I would suggest that it needs to be
cut to two pages - or preferably 800 words.  I know this is short - but
short pieces get attention.  For example, my Sept 13 op ed in the NY Times
got oil released from the SPR.  We have the content - now we need the red
pen.

Subject: VEPCO Information Request

To all:

In our last meeting with VEPCO we presented a structure that would 

1).  Allow Enron to sell the Edgecombe plant to VEPCO at a fixed price at the 
end of the term of the PPA (around $325/kW)
2).  Allow VEPCO to buy the plant from us at a fixed price at the end of the 
term of the PPA (around $425/kW).

This structure caps our downside risk into a quantifiable number (it also 
limits our upside but we're willing to give that up to protect against a big 
negative hit).


In order to evaluate this structure, VEPCO has asked for some specific plant 
information.  We have most of this info in various forms and I would like 
your help pulling it together.

1).  Full plant description (equipment, design, drawings)
2).  Construction costs (have we gotten updated NEPCO numbers for this 
project?)
3).  Permits (timeline for obtaining, run hours allowed on both natural gas 
and fuel oil, emission limits)
4).  Fuel contracts (in process).

Please let me know what you have and an estimate on timing to get the rest of 
the request.

If we can negotiate this structure with VEPCO, we will make a significant 
jump in getting the internal okay to move forward.

Thanks for your help,

Heather

Melissa,

Those numbers are all inclusive for the wellhead portfolio.  Sharp's number 
is embedded within those.  His number is estimated at approx $170,000/mo.  
I will follow up with these specific details.

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you,

CANINE HOLIDAY ETIQUETTE

(Submitted by a ""Daily Inspiration"" subscriber)

1. Be especially patient with your humans during this time. They may
appear to be more stressed-out than usual and they will appreciate long
comforting dog leans.


2. They may come home with large bags of things they call gifts. Do not
assume that all the gifts are yours.


3. Be tolerant if your humans put decorations on you. They seem to get
some special kind of pleasure out of seeing how you look with fake
antlers.


4. They may bring a large tree into the house and set it up in a prominent
place and cover it with lights and decorations. Bizarre as this may seem
to you, it is an important ritual for your humans, so there are some
things you need to know:

- don't go to the bathroom on the tree

- don't drink water in the container that holds the tree

- mind your tail when you are near the tree

- if there are packages under the tree, even ones that smell interesting
or that have your    name on them, don't rip them open

- don't chew on the cord that runs from the funny-looking hole in the wall
to the tree


5. Your humans may occasionally invite lots of strangers to come visit
during this season. These parties can be lots of fun, but they also call
for some discretion on your part:

- not all strangers appreciate kisses and leans

- don't eat off the buffet table

- beg for goodies subtly

- be pleasant, even if unknowing strangers sit on your sofa

- don't drink out of glasses that are left within your reach


6. Likewise, your humans may take you visiting. Here your manners will
also be important:

- observe all the rules in #4 for trees that may be in other people's

houses. (4a is particularly important)

- respect the territory of other animals that may live in the house

- tolerate children

- turn on your charm big time


7. A big man with a white beard and a very loud laugh may emerge from your
fireplace in the middle of the night.

DO NOT BITE HIM!!

God bless you! Have a great Christmas filled with God's goodness.

Donnie, for July, adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from 
Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT.  I 
may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables 
are netting to 0.

For August, September, October, and November, make the Clinton volumes match 
the Phillips and Power Gas Marketing Supply and DO send an invoice adjustment 
to Clinton.

Paul, let me know if you have questions.  For July, the imbalance is actually 
in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.  For August forward, I 
believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes 
since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.  Let me know if you want to 
make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want these 
deals to go away.  Oh yeah, and make Clinton a lot of money!

Wade, for July and August, give me the actual volumes and price for Phillips

MMBTU's?  AND do we back out any gathering charges on this gas?

Subject: CNG/Peoples Natural Gas

Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I 
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.  
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of 
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So 
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria

Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The Enron Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin

Doug, 

Here's the revised CA.? I highlighted the changed terms.? In addition, I 
deleted the prior paragraph 11 which said that the agreement supercedes a 
prior CA. 

I don't know if the InterGen indentity and signatory are the same,? but 
obviously I left that for you to determine.? I expect that the Enron entity 
which will bid will be EPMI, so I used that entity. 

(See attached file: InterGen North America CA may 18.doc) 

I beefed up the definition of confidential information due to the 
complexity of the issues, and I added 6 months to? the term since things 
won't get cranked up for a while. 

I look forward to talking to you at your convenience.? Have a good weekend. 

Kay

is the first time we have observed this national holiday, and I am certain 
that many of you will be pleased to know that the executive committee has 
decided that we will continue to do so in the future.

Enron continues to observe 10 holidays each year (including two floater 
holidays) and provides one additional discretionary holiday for our

I will tell him what I know, although I haven't looked at a food processor in some time.  

Matt - I would suggest you talk to Matt Gravelle from ConAgra.  I have done him some favors over the years.  They are a big food processor with Beatrice Hunt Wesson.  He will know all the big tomato processors which are 80% of the food processing load.  Others include Tri-Valley.  I would try to get as many names and phone numbers as you can and call them up and ask them their plans.  My bet is cooler and wetter weather will result in a lower and later harvest and hence gas usage.  
The fruit driers are the other 20% and they are much less concentrated and it will be hard to get a handle on their usage.

Also, what's up with EES?  Do they have any marketers anymore?  Dan Bergmann used to be very effective in getting deals done with the food processors, but they laid him off.

Jan:  Thanks for your note.  Tim Belden has asked Dana to book a conference 
room - maybe you can coordinate with her.  It might also be nice if there is 
a spare office or two that could be booked for the day (including the 
morning) so we will have a place to work when not in the meetings.  The only 
people I know of coming from out of town will be me and Ken Raisler, a lawyer 
with Sullivan & Cromwell in New York.  We will have a better idea of any 
audio-visual equipment we need as we get closer to the meeting date.

Steve is out of the country this week - but I checked his schedule and it 
looks like Nov. 29 in DC would work best. 

I will go ahead and pencil that in on Steve's schedule.

HEADLINE: California contracts for power at a lot less
 
BYLINE: BLOOMBERG
 
DATELINE: LOS ANGELES
 
BODY:
 
   LOS ANGELES (Bloomberg) - California Gov.  Gray Davis said the state
agreed
 to buy electricity from more than 20 suppliers over 10 years at an average
price
 of $69 per megawatt-hour, less than half the average price utilities paid
last
 year.
 
   California's Department of Water Resources will buy as much as 8,886
 megawatts, enough to light about 9 million homes, under contracts ranging
from
 four months to 20 years.  The suppliers include Enron Corp., Calpine Corp.,
Duke
 Energy Corp., Williams Cos Inc., Dynegy Inc.  and Reliant Energy.
 
   California's two biggest electric utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &
 Electric and Edison International's Southern California Edison, owe more
than $
 12 billion to power generators and can't buy more.  The utilities have been
 paying more for power than California regulators allow them to charge
consumers.
 The state is buying power on behalf of the utilities.
 
   ""These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy,"" Mr.
Davis
 told reporters in Los Angeles.  He expects the price of electricity in the
 contracts will prevent the need for further rate increases.
 
   Prices are higher in the first five years, averaging $79 a megawatt-hour,
 then fall to $61 in the past five years, Mr.  Davis said. The state also
signed
 11 short-term contracts last month to reduce purchases made in day-ahead
markets
 to an average of $228 a megawatt-hour, down from $330.
 
   In 2000, the price that California's three biggest utilities paid for
power
 averaged $120 a megawatt-hour, and reached a high of $1,500 on Dec. 12.
 
   The long-term contracts will supply about 75 percent of the power that
 utilities have been unable to purchase for their customers, Mr.  Davis
said.
 That's only about one quarter of California's consumption.
 
   ""This is not a done deal.  We have additional deals that are being put to
 bed,"" said Davis negotiator David Freeman, general manager of the Los
Angeles
 Department of Water & Power.  The state expects to purchase another 2,000
 megawatts in contracts that are still being worked out, Mr.  Freeman said.
 
   Still, some generators have been unwilling to supply the state power
needed
 to avert blackouts this summer because of other contract obligations and
high
 natural gas prices.
 
   Earlier yesterday, Duke said it tentatively agreed to sell about $4
billion
 in electricity to California from 2002 to 2010, which would guarantee power
to
 the state after repeated shortages and emergencies this year.
 
   Calpine Corp.  agreed last week to supply 1,500 megawatts of power to the
DWR
 in 10-year and 20-year contracts valued at as much as $8.3 billion. Calpine
and
 Duke refused to sell the state power this summer because the supplies
already
 have been sold.
 
   ""There are about 7,000 megawatts for this summer and deals are still in
the
 works,"" Mr.  Freeman said.

LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 6, 2001--Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power Daily Energy Update for Tuesday, March 6, 2001:



-- The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) continues to
   provide power to our native load customers and surplus energy to
   California. Yesterday, DWP provided between 75 Megawatts (MW) and
   125 MW for a three-hour period to the state through the
   California Energy Resource Scheduling unit.

-- DWP forecasts a peak energy load today in Los Angeles of 3,500 MW.

-- DWP has up to 100 MW of energy available today for sale.

-- This energy will be available to California entities to assist
   them in meeting their normal and emergency energy needs. No power
   will be sold outside of the state during any DOE-certified or ISO
   staged emergency.

-- DWP has 24 major thermal generating units at eight facilities.
   Today, fifteen units are operating including eight of ten base
   load units. Of the nine units not operating, three units have
   scheduled major maintenance activities underway; five units are
   undergoing minor maintenance; and the remaining unit is available
   for use, as the market requires. Hydro resources and pumped
   storage facilities can also be used to meet market demands.

-- The rolling blackouts from power shortages that have occurred in
   other parts of California will not be felt by DWP customers.

-- While electric rates have increased for some utilities in
   California, Los Angeles City residents continue to enjoy stable
   rates that have remained unchanged for nine years. DWP provides
   electricity and water to the city's 3.8 million residents.

Talked with Tom Deen today. He wants to depose either Miller or Virgo on 3/9
and the other of them the next day, Friday 3/10. I said I'd check their
availability. Can you advise? He also said he wanted to depose another Enron
employee whom he claims actually went to Korea: one Harry Moltreu (sp.?)
Any idea who this is? He agrees on mediating the last 2 weeks in March, and
to a continuance of the April setting. He also confirmed that Natole had
sold either all or part of his business, but retained all interest in the
lawsuit. I said we'd want to go through this in Natole's deposition, and he
said they would have the details then. Natole is on for next Friday 2/18.

Greetings:
Sorry to bother you with this, but please see notes below.  I need to find 
out who I can contact to get information on our noncore accounts.  I'm 
assuming that you might know whom that would be.  Thanks a million. Hope 
all's well.

Good Morning Jeff,

Catherine is out of the office until Tuesday 3/20/01.  Not wanting to keep 
you waiting for a reply, I thought it best to give you some feedback 
immediately.  

The great majority of CAD's customers in CA are core.  CAD does not knowingly 
terminate any current customer prior to their expiration date. The reasons 
why CAD's customers are turned back to the utility are as follows:

1) Upon receiving renewal pricing from the CAD rep,  the customer chooses to 
return to the utility.

2) Understanding that the current minimum margin per meter for our customers 
is approximately $300, those customers that have extremely low annual volumes 
are sent attrition letters and turned back to the LDC, at the end of their 
contract.  We cannot competitively price this type of customer versus the 
utility, and extract enough margin to support them. Currently in the 
California markets (PG&E, SDG&E, & SOCAL) , there exists approximately 50 
customers that have usages so low that given current market conditions, we 
will not choose to renew the contracts.  The expiration dates for these are 
between 5/30/2001 and 2/28/2005.

3) The customer initiates a request for termination prior to the end of their 
contractual expiration date.  As we are all aware, California customers, 
specifically those with either an index or NYMEX product, experienced a large 
swing in their pricing during the past few months.  CAD has been inundated 
with customers requesting to be returned to their LDC.  Although we seek to 
satisfy our customer to the best of our ability,  returning these customers 
to the utility is the LAST thing we want to do!!!!!!!  

The steps we have taken to address this issue is to:
 a) work with customer service/credit to offer extended payment options to 
ease the effect of the increase.
 b) offer to restructure the customer's contract, and reprice the customer on 
a fixed price product; minimizing their risk going forward.
 c) explain to the customer, in more detail, the reasons why this has 
occurred, and how, going forward, the index/NYMEX pricing has eased.  

Should you have additional questions, please reply or call.
-Jim

Subject: More Inquiries From CA PUC re: Switching customers back to LDC

Greetings:
 
Recall that about 3 weeks we got a call from a CA PUC staffer asking whether 
we'd switched a particular gas customer (or two) back to the LDC.  We looked 
into it and discovered that we'd mistakenly switched the customer back due to 
a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two 
different utilities.  We informed the PUC staffer of the mix-up and explained 
that the situation would be resolved.  

The questions from the staffer arose because the CA PUC made a bad decision a 
couple of months ago. When gas prices ran up at the California border a lot 
of large (""noncore"") customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff 
in the hope of lowering gas costs.  In response, SoCalGas filed with the 
Commission asking the PUC to prohibit customers from switching back.  The 
Commission agreed and put the prohibition in place.  The Commission is now 
concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers (for 
whatever reason), or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire, 
customers won't have the option of returning to LDC service.

Today, I received a letter from the President of the Commission asking me to 
respond to the following:

Have you ""stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any non-core 
customers with whom you have an existing procurement contract, or...notified 
any of your non-core customers that you do not intend to renew an existing 
natural gas commodity procurement contract.  If your company has stopped or 
intends to stop serving non-core customers, the CPUC also needs to know

how many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminate
the natural gas volumes involved
the location of the non-core customer(s)
the reason(s) your company intends or has already acted to terminate those 
contracts.""

There's a good chance that the letter from the President of the Commission is 
linked to the fact that we've recently switched our electricity customers 
back to utility service in California.  

Prior to deciding whether and how to respond to the Commissioner, I'm trying 
to get handle on whether we're re-sourcing any gas retail customers to the 
utility prior to expiration, choosing not to renew contracts once they've 
expired, etc.  Catherine, or Jim Foster, can you help out?  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Mark - I'm so sorry I haven't responded yet, but yes, I did get your e-mail. 
I actually solved most of the issues detailed on the spreadsheet, but wanted 
to finish before I sent the document back. I've attached the spreadsheet with 
what I've done so far, and I'm forwarding most of the remaining deals to Bill 
Williams in Real Time. The two deals with volume discrepancies are going to 
take some looking into - I think they're in the system correctly and it's 
probably just an error in my spreadsheet - but I'll let you know. Again, 
sorry for the delay.

Thanks,
Kate

		 Subject: FERC Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power 
Systems

Please forward this to Rick's group.  Thanks.

Please note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful 
information that can be used at the state PUC level, including information on 
the increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute 
to lack of price caps following the summer 1998 price spikes; better 
preparation for summer 2000 through the use of forward contracts and 
transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from 
particular markets.


On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit."")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively"" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, 
personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another 
good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and 
assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very 
smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and 
he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a 
couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his 
existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper 
already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the 
short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she 
could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good 
option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary 
Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck 
(advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick 
thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early 
versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the 
marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure 
that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John 
Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday 
afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to 
add a trading perspective?

A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.

mike

Mike,

Jason Peters, who was a lawyer seconded with us from Andrews & Kurth, has now 
gone back to A&K, but is still doing some work for us.  Is there some way for 
us to get him access to the Financial Trading Agreement database?  He is a 
lawyer, and is bound by client confidentiality with respect to all the 
information in the database, so I don't think we need to worry about granting 
him security access.  Can we get him access?

Attached is a memo to ESA employees that Diomedes and I have been working 
on.  I don't think there will be any concerns except for the section in 
bold.  It does admit that we are looking at the potential sale of some 
assets, although the message is softened up quite a bit.  Will it cause 
widespread panic or live up to our vision and values that communication is 
good.  Please review and comment ASAP.  This memo will be the basis for 
preparing Jim to go on e-speak, although we will NOT specifically address the 
potential asset sale issue there except in an answer to a question.

Thomas,

TBG Cogen Partners is disputing the rate invoiced by ENA for November 2001 gas. ENA invoiced a rate of $3.4367 for deal # 22957. The customer claims the rate should be as follows: first 4,000/d @ $2.25, remainder over 4,000 @ monthly index of delivery location + $.025. Please review and advise.

Rod-

Nice to see your name - I haven't seen you in a while as I'm no longer attending Causey's meetings since I'm in RAC.  

It's fine for Enron subsidiaries to have their own risk management policies that fit within Enron's risk management policy, and because we do want them to meet Enron's requirements, I'm glad you're working with Frank so we can help you work through it.  In addition, I'm in the process of re-writing Enron's risk management policy, and if there are certain transportation and distribution risk management issues that we should be addressing, I'd like to discuss those with you so we can incorporate those into this version of Enron's policy.

Our current version of the Enron policy that was approved in this month's BOD meeting is attached FYI.

 

Thanks,

Cassandra.

Rod,
I spoke Cheryl regarding Caminus and value-at-risk.  She indicated that you are working on a cohesive policy for ETS, one that could potentially include Portland General.  I believe that I can add some value to your efforts.  Much of the control issues regarding Enron's affiliates allow for some flexibility at the business unit level, although overall limits, methodologies and policies would be subjugated to Board approved structure.  Enron's next Board meeting is in August and the deadline for submitting requests would be Tuesday, July 10th.

Please feel free to use me as a sounding board and let me know if there is anything you require from RAC.

Thanks,
Frank

Register before Friday June 1 and save $100 ! 
Is current storage fill giving us 
a false sense of security? 
It's May. And those AGA storage numbers might have us feeling pretty secure about the future. But a lot can happen in a few short months. Consider these likely scenarios:
This summer hot or hotter than last summer? Predictions abound. 
Record number of new gas fired electric generation units on-line this summer, increasing demand and the draw on storage. 
Severe drought affecting hydropower, the lowest output in 30 years. 
Natural gas supply availability virtually unchanged from last year's levels.                        Fact or fiction?

We shall send you natural gas Henry Hub prices right away.
Please look at the last winter and the winter of
95/96.

We shall prepare for you the electricity price
information (Cinergy, Cobb and Palo Verde) but
you have to approach FT (the publishers of
Megawatts Daily, a newsletter that produces the price
index we recommend using)  and request the permision
to use the data. We are not allowed to distribute
this information.

Please, explain that this is for academic  research and that
we can produce the time series for you,
conditional on the permission from the publishers
of Megawatts Daily.

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Drs. Richard MacMinn and
Patrick Brockett. I am now working on my dissertation which is focused on
the weather derivatives and credit derivatives.

Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?

The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you
please offer me some energy price data during that time period?

Your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day!

Mulong

This is a tremendous 1980 example of a large Deborah Butterfield.  I think it 
would be worth seriously considering....

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - She=
 Said Updated 11/21/01 Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday tha=
t indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months a=
nd possibly the remainder of the season, according to the Florida Times-Uni=
on. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need mo=
re time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain in=
 his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Tay=
lor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably h=
old onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep en=
ough bench.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods Updated 11/21/01 Smith's spr=
ained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there=
 is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered=
 the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should pro=
bably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your =
expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't=
 the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexand=
er , RB SEA - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expe=
cted to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal po=
int of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. H=
e should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady=
 , QB NE - Baby Blues Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady f=
or now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any =
changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy sta=
rter right now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy if yo=
u can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may hav=
e to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's=
 status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The W=
ounded Ducks Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed=
 enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to =
return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continu=
e to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into=
 view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hillrods Update! d ! 11/20/01 Mike Riley =
told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Fluti=
e and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""Y=
ou can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this b=
uilding. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win =
the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most F=
antasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener=
 will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His los=
s may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely=
 regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley =
, RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he =
is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.=
  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Baby Blues Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may pla=
y this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practic=
e early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - The Leather Cheerios Updated 1=
1/20/01Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a ri=
sky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 11/20/01 Th=
e Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's prac=
tice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss=
 any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She Said Update=
d 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to sta=
rt against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Cali Bound Updated 11/20/01 Min=
nis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have =
to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01=
 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game agai=
nst New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome P=
athon , WR IND - Xtreme Updated 11! /2! 0/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the =
season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurt=
ing, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting=
 lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/20/01 Dave W=
annstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Field=
er and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Ja=
y is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away=
 and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods Upda=
ted 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be s=
ufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll g=
et a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the De=
nver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situ=
ation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, =
then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE =
- Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis w=
on't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get =
him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Locket=
t , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury=
 last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphi=
a. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this=
 point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any set=
backs, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suff=
ered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after ef=
fects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Gr=
een , WR TB - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to r=
eturn to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent thi=
s season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens ,=
 WR SF - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained lef=
t knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against=
 Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is ex=
pected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin =
, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury d=
uring Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but =
is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has n=
o real value as a Fantasy player, but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley. =
   Giants , DT NYG - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 According to the =
New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee beg=
an giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsur=
e that he'd be! a! ble to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday =
night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you sh=
ould consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season=
.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/20/01 The Baltim=
ore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team=
's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most F=
antasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver i=
s still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's gam=
e against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy playe=
r at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Xtreme Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end=
 Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee sur=
gery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defens=
e and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    Cowb=
oys , DT DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakl=
ey, who was ! ex! pected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will lik=
ely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help=
 keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give=
 Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - =
Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's =
game against Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my =
job,"" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fant=
asy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if a=
t all possible.     More Updates   Teams, Rosters  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]=

Yes, these functions are covered in the Netco list put together by Bob.   Under the tab labeled ""Documentation"" in the electronic list sent to me by Amy Fitzpatrick, there are certain employees whose job titles include the phrase ""Global Management"" - meaning global databases, including counterparty.  Bill Hare is on the Netco list, and is the most knowledgeable person in the company regarding the global counterparty database.  Contract administration for gas and power has been handled by Kim Theriot's group, and Kim has accounted for that activity in her listing of employees for Netco.  --Sally

Chris,

I'm looking for gas delivered to two Tetco M2 interconnects with TCo.

At the minimum, I'm looking for an offer for a flat baseload volume for 
December flow.  My preference is to get an offer for a flat baseload volume 
from December through March.  The points and volumes are:
 Delmont {Volume:  3,712/day}
 Windrifge {Volume:  2,859/day}

Can I get a nymex plus offer?

Thanks.

Scott,
Meredith Homco and I both were working on Tetco during the December 00 and March 01. Meredith mentioned to me that she had gone over some items regarding this issue previously with someone is settlements.  I'd like for us to get with her and see if we can't get this resolved faster with her involvement. I'm out of the office today at an off site customer meeting but could be available tomorrow.  Meredith -- what does your schedule look like Wednesday afternoon? Can you save 10-20 minutes for me and Scott. Please let me know you availability.

Cindy

Subject:	Re: Colonial Outstanding AR   

John - Apologies for the long note below but I believe it will be useful to get into the detail to resolve our Colonial recall issues.

Below is some detail on Colonial discrepancies involved with recallable deals in Dec-00 and Mar-01.  Please advise as to what the next course of action should be to clear this up.  I would be happy to meet with any one involved to clarify any issues or questions.

Overview:  I am still unclear as to what recallable means.  It sounds from your note below and everything that Cindy has told me, that by recall you simply mean a buy back or back-to-back as it resides within our system.  However, Colonial is not billing or settling it that way.  They are wanting to collect on their sale for these items while considering our sales for these as never having flowed.  Unless, I am missing something from your conversations with Colonial their may be a disconnect with them.

Note, the first section attached is fairly straight forward.   All recall sales being disputed by Colonial involve direct back-to-back sales with Colonial.  As for deal #658124, I see no problems between Sitara and Unify; Colonial is questioning only 4,500 on day 8 and no other gas on deal 336733.  In fact, Unify will not allow an imbalance on all back-to-back or brokered deals.

Section two shows the items that Colonial has claimed as recalled in Dec-00.  They have yet to give me days so I can not break out the items from our market to our sales to Colonial.  But, they all involve back-to-backs.

Section three shows other TETC items in dispute.  I listed these simply because I consider it possible that these may be involved in the recall items in question.

Thank you - Scott Dozier

According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?

Attached please find referenced list.  The only amended counterparty with a 
change was Murphy Exploration which was shut down for power.  I wonder, when 
we are working with amended counterparties, if there is some way that my 
prior approval could be on the recent spread sheet?  Right now I have to go 
find the old spread sheet to find out what I approved it for last time to see 
if I have any problem with the change.  So usually, unless I have - change 
next to amended, it means I had no change to what I said before.  Does that 
make sens?

Gentlemen,

Below is a draft org announcement I would like to send out to the HR team 
today or towmorrow, essentially clarifying responsibilities following the 
formation of EGM and EIM. I do not intend to circulate outside HR other than 
to then 7 of you, Cindy O and the other HR leads. This essentially reflects 
what I hope you already know that your HR lead support is:

ENA - Me with Sheila Knudsen (I ultimately hope Cindy Skinner will move to 
take this lead sometime next year).
EGM - Cindy Skinner and Shanna Funkhouser (We believe Shanna will develop to 
lead this in the next 12 months)
EIM - Me and Fran Mayes (the plan would be for Fran to eventually take lead 
on this when she is ready).


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

David

Western Hemisphere Wholesale Energy HR Group Organisation Change

When we launched our HR Franchise Team structure in February this year we did 
so with the commitment to continually refine and challenge ourselves to 
ensure we were optimising the resources we have available to help our 
businesses achieve and exceed their goals. In fact you will recall in 
communicating the changes in February, we actually highlighted what we 
anticipated would be a need to make further refinements and changes to 
maximise our effectiveness.

A great deal has happened in these last 6 months and I am delighted that the 
Franchise team concept has contributed so much towards our far greater 
partnership with our individual business groups and our own outlook, 
priorities and objectives. We truly have revolutionised how we provide HR 
services and advice. More importantly, the business has recognised us for the 
huge progress we have made to date. This success is an outstanding 
achievement and one that I hope you join me in being extremely proud of.

As is always the case at Enron, continuous change is the norm and so as to 
illustrate this point quite effectively the businesses previously part of ENA 
have over the last 2 months, essentially been split into three: Enron Global 
Markets, set up to focus on the Global Fuels markets which were previously 
part of Enron Europe and CALME,  Coal, Financial Tarding and 
Insurance/Weather which were all previously part of ENA. EGM is now led by 
Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman. Enron Industrial Markets, set up to focus 
on the Industrial markets and expand our activities across new Industrial 
sectors which will build on the success of the Paper, Pulp and Lumber 
business previously part of ENA and immediately develop a steel market. EIM 
is led by Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen. Enron North America remains the largest 
of these three businesses even after these changes and will now focus all of 
its efforts on the highly successful Gas and Power markets in North America, 
including Canada and Mexico. ENA continues to be led by Dave Delainey and 
John Lavorato. Mark Frevert, following his return from Europe, has been 
instrumental in the restructuring of these businesses and is Chairman of each 
of these as well as Enron Europe, which collectively now constitute Enron's 
entire activities in the Wholesale commodity markets.

These changes in the businesses we support clearly force us to re-examine the 
HR business model and adjust our strategy accordingly. Fortunately, our 
flexible organisation structure lends itself extremely well to realign along 
these new business lines and as such the changes illustrated below in the 
attached org chart are far easier for us to make than they might otherwise 
have been. In addition, given the immense value and positive client feedback 
we have received on our efforts to concentrate our HR resources on Franchise 
skill lines, this also provides us with an opportunity to reinforce and 
refine our efforts in developing market intelligence, employment 
propositions, compensation ideas and best practices, as well as the 
innovatively sourced talent pipelines in each of these areas to pro-actively 
provide our clients with a competitive advantage.

I believe the changes outlined on the attached org chart are self 
explanatory, however if you have any questions please feel free to raise them 
either with your team leads or me. Given that we have a staff meeting 
scheduled for Friday I would plan to walk through these changes with you and 
answer any questions at that time.

Finally, to reinforce our goals and prepare you all for the next 6 months, I 
would like to underline the overall commitment to continue to change and flex 
our resources to anticipate, meet and exceed our businesses needs. This will 
clearly mean further organisation changes as we move forward. This is not 
Change for change's sake, but change, and our ability to change quickly and 
as often as necessary, is essential for us to remain a competitive and 
effective HR resource for our clients.

																					Public Offered Units of Williams 
																					Energy Partners
																					
																					
																					
																					?  ? Williams will offer the public a 32% stake in its Williams  Energy 
Partners petroleum storage and distribution partnership.  Williams Energy 
Partners filed with the SEC to register 3.75 million  common units, which 
will be listed on the NYSE under the symbol  'WEG'. Williams will own 68% of 
the Williams Energy partnership  after the sale. The partnership consists of 
four petroleum products  terminals along the Gulf Coast and the New York 
harbor, 24 inland  petroleum product terminals and an ammonia pipeline. 
Lehman Brothers  will underwrite the sale which is expected to begin next 
January.  The estimated total proceeds would be about $90 million if the  
underwriters exercise an option to sell an additional 562,500 units  if 
needed to meet investor demand. If that overallotment option is  
																					
																					
																					
																					
																																									
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																exercised, the public would have a 37% stake in the  partnership. The four 
marine terminals have a storage capacity of  more than 17.6 million barrels. 
The 1,100 mile-long pipeline  transports and distributes ammonia from 
production facilities in  Texas and Oklahoma to various distribution points. 
Ammonia is  produced from natural gas and is used primarily as a nitrogen  
fertilizer. Williams did not name an individual price for the common  units. 
It would expect to receive net proceeds of about $70 million  from the sale 
of the 3.75 million common units, based on a?  unit price of $20. WEG will 
use the proceeds, together with $90  million from its line of credit, to 
repay $156 million of debt owned  to Williams. Williams Energy will offer 
holders of the units a  quarterly distribution of $0.52 per unit each 
quarter. Last week,  Williams said third-quarter profit more than quadrupled, 
beating  estimates.

																																		DTE,  MCN Merger to Close Next Year 
																																		
																																		
																																		? ?  DTE Energy Holding says it is unlikely that the merger with MCN  Energy 
Group will close this year. The delay is due to the  companies' decision to 
sell a portion of MCN's natural gas  distribution capacity to a unit of 
Exelon, which is subject to  Michigan PSC review.

Dr. Kaminski, I would like to thank you very much for taking care of Amy and 
me
during our trip to Houston. What I saw at Enron Communication was nothing 
short
of revolutionary. More than that, I was impressed with the drive of the 
people,
their kindness, and their proficiency. I look forward to meeting you again in
Stanford during the last weekend of February. I will send you an email next
week, so that we can arrange a meeting between you and Prof. Bambos.
All the best wishes,

Giuseppe

I made a couple changes and saved them to my attached file (I  renamed it 
with my initials so you'd know which version had come from me).?  I want to 
take a closer look at this and maybe offer a few more later this  morning.? 
All in all, I think everyone's on the right  track.

The Gas Spec (Oil NG Hedge) book will show a MTD variance of $819,000 today.  
When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not 
divide by 1,000.  Therefore the incorrect p&l was reported.  However, John 
Lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included 
in today's daily p&l on the NGP&L.  

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.

Thanks,
Robin"

Attached is a useful presentation on Securitazation.  We may want to propose 
this approach when the utility's CTC recovery period is shorter than we would 
prefer.  A utility may propose a shorter period due to cash flow and bond 
rating reasons; whereas, we might had taken a view of a longer recovery 
period in our curves.  Securitization might be the perfect win-win solution.  
If you would like a presentation on Securitization, please contact Jaime 
Araoz.

I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn't want 
to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis. I told him I told 
you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say. He said they are 
looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality.

Richard,

We are not going to send this letter until Monday.  We want to send the
formal objections to the subpoena concurrently, and Mike Smith cannot review
the EES objections until Monday.  Mike Day believes that a delay until
Monday is not a problem.  Let me know if you have any concerns.

 Tipper Gore, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered
 that her husband's great-great uncle, Gunther Gore, a fellow
 lacking in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train
 robbery in Tennessee in 1889.

 The only known photograph of Gunther shows him standing
 on the gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription:
 ""Gunther Gore; horse thief, sent to Tennessee Prison 1885,
 escaped 1887, robbed the Tennessee Flyer six times. Caught
 by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.""

 After letting Al Gore and his staff of professional image
 consultants peruse the findings, they decided to crop Gunther's
 picture, scan it in as an enlarged image, and edited it with
 image processing software so that all that's seen is a head shot.

 The accompanying biographical sketch was sent to the
 Associated Press as follows:

 ""Gunther Gore was a famous
 rancher in early Tennessee history. His business empire
 grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets
 and intimate dealings with the Tennessee railroad.
 Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to
 service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume
 his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in
 a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective
 Agency. In 1889, Gunther passed away during an important
 civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which
 he was standing, collapsed.""

As a follow-up to our discussion at the June 29 HR PRC meeting, attached is 
criteria for using the Senior Director level that was established/agreed to 
by the ETS executive officers in May, 2001.  The need for this criteria was 
discussed at the final year-end 2000 ETS PRC meeting and agreement was 
reached prior to the mid-year 2001 PRC meetings.  The criteria was used in 
the final mid-year ETS PRC meeting on June 28.  There were no new Senior 
Directors approved at mid-year for ETS.

From casual observations, I cannot dispute your ratings.   I do feel that 
Dave needs to step up to the plate and start delivering some new and creative 
solutions for outstanding issues.  He has the capabilities.   It seems he 
tends to manage too much by wandering around and not taking the lead.

I fully support Barney's rating, but could see both Dave and Larry's ratings 
being on the lower edge of the recommended ratings.

I will do all I can to shore up the organization by placing some expectations 
for improvements before the whole group and dividing up the accountabilities 
accordingly.

I fully support what you have recommended.

These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some 
specifics for the last few months.     A short discussion with Phil might 
lead me to believe that he would think I might be being too generous on 
Dave.     What are your thoughts?

In the absence of a fix it looks as though we have another VaR violation.

It looks like the Canadian positions didn't hit VAR last night.  Can you re-check?
Also, I understand Zufferli bot a ton of NG and I thought he was short? (Why is system showing he is long?)

Today's focus: Web-based admin for MySQL

By Phil Hochmuth

Enterprise database administrators using open source software
such as Linux and especially MySQL may want to research a new
tool called PHPMyAdmin, a Web-based administration program for
MySQL databases.

The free, open source software based on the PHP script language
could be used to run multiple management tasks on a MySQL
database, or an entire MySQL server over a Web connection.

PHPMyAdmin runs with either PHP3 or PHP4 and MySQL database
versions 3.21.x - 3.23.x. All administration tasks are done
through a Web browser. The developers of the software recommend
using the latest version of Apache with PHPMyAdmin.

PHPMyAdmin lets users create or delete a database on a MySQL
server from any IP connection, whether on a local intranet, or
remotely over the Web. Users also can alter database tables and
fields on a MySQL database server. The software also lets users
run SQL statements as well as batch queries. Text files can be
loaded into the database with the software.

This free tool could be useful for Web site administrators
running PHP, Apache and MySQL in a Linux environment by
allowing for the remote management of Web or internal
databases, and the creation of Web databases on the fly.

The Office of Pipeline Safety advised last evening that there have been at least two incidents in different areas of the country in which unauthorized individuals entered pipeline stations and appeared interested in manifolds and other pipeline facilities.  When confronted by pipeline employees, the individuals said they were lost and asked for directions.  Upon departing, the individuals did not follow the provided directions.  On one occasion, employees obtained the car license number, and the individual was detained by the FBI and is awaiting a deportation hearing.  Both of these events were reported to local FBI offices.  It is not known if the two events were connected.

OPS has asked to be advised as soon as possible of any similar intrusions or other unauthorized physical, photographic or electronic surveillance of pipeline facilities.  If you become aware of any such activities, please notify Corporate Security (x52804) immediately.

The FBI has extended its generic terrorist threat advisory through January 2, 2002, due to the continuing potential for terrorist attacks in the U.S.  The FBI urges continued vigilance during the seasonal holiday period.  "

Greetings:

Please review the attached.  It's a summary I've put together of a very=20
lengthy analysis MRW did for us over the weekend.  I've also attached the=
=20
considerably lengthier MRW memo for those who'd like to see it.  The tables=
=20
included in the summary are pulled directly from the MRW memo.  The analysi=
s=20
only addresses the utilities undercollection (i.e., solvency) and doesn't=
=20
address any additional increases that might result from DWR's buying=20
activities.

The Bottom Line
=06=15 By raising average rates 10% over a 10-year period, California could=
 1)=20
return the utilities to solvency, and 2) help close the  supply-demand gap =
by=20
providing customers with better price signals.
=06=15 California could achieve these goals under this new rate structure a=
nd at=20
the same time exclude one-third of residential  customers from any increase=
s.=20
If California chose not to exclude any customers from the new rate structur=
e,=20
California  would only need to raise average rates by about 8.8%.
=06=15 This level of increase is in line with increases enacted in other st=
ates=20
(e.g., Washington: 28-34%; Montana: 4.5-32%; Idaho:  6.0-24%; Nevada:=20
7-12.5%; New Mexico 12%).

We'll need to look at it critically and try to shoot holes in it before goi=
ng=20
public with the numbers as part of our broader effort, but it offers a=20
reasonable benchmark against which to judge alternatives (like spending the=
=20
kids lunch money on crumbling, broken down transmission systems).

Please provide feedback as soon as possible, and perhaps, Paul we conclude=
=20
the MRW work on the agenda for discussion on tomorrow's daily conference ca=
ll.

Best,
Jeff

Steve, I am interested in being on the transition team.  I was on the team at Minute Maid when Coca-Cola was selling 50% of the company to Proctor and Gamble.  Although the deal fell through in the end (after I had left), it allowed me to gain a vast array of knowledge regarding the merging of two companies, their benefits and their employees.  One of my major duties was looking at adverse impact and comparison of benefits to ensure that employees would be ""whole"" when the deal was finalized.  I was also the liaison for Minute Maid during Coca-Cola's class action lawsuit.  If you have any additional questions regarding my experience, please do not hesitate to call me at x51580 or at home 281.880.6615."

I wanted to see if the address worked.  We had a good time in NO.  We 
definitely want to go back.  It was really crowded, but fun.  The weather was 
good and the food was great.  How is DC?  Have you seen any of the sights 
yet?  

I wanted to ask if you can help with C&C on the 16th and 17th of May when we 
are in Chicago.  I know your schedule just got alot more hectic, so let me 
know.  They can stay in Conroe on Fri and Sat.  We leave Wed night and return 
Sun morning.  It would mean be staying at our house on those nights and 
getting them to school.  If you can't, we will try to get one of the 
neighbors.  

Thanks.  See you when you get back.

RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 4/20


RECENT EVENTS:

-- IEP with the help of Chris Ellison has been at the negotiating table mos=
t
of the week dealing with the most recent amendments to SB 28x.  SB 28x
(Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many
IEP-sponsored proposals.  As you will recall, two new provisions were added
to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing
with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating
facilities.  Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decided
not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision
remained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold
their opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiate
on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that
already have retrofit requirements.  I will be faxing out the agreed upon
language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the
completion of any mandated retrofits.  It does not expand the authority of
the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The
schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or such
later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability.

With these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will be
voted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for
concurrence on Tuesday.  The final version will include the following
IEP-sponsored proposals:

? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act
requirements
? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE=
C
? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power
plant sites
? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed
project.
? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency
review.
? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process
established in AB 970.

Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process,
IEP member should now be thinking about what is next.  IEP proposals still
on the table include:

? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for
power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance
? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies
? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements.
? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements

-- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good=
 news.
The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new
power plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expedited
permitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can=
.
Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege.  This
issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to
include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power
plant project.

AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that a
developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California
entities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee.  IEP
members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure
regardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments are
definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied.

-- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendm=
ents
attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x
(Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure.  Attached is a copy o=
f
the bill in PDF form.  The agreed upon language, which clarifies that the
Authority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can=
 be
found on pages 6-7 (Section 3310), 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17
(Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton
in the press lately regarding seizing generation assets, this was most
likely the best we could get.

-- The first of Senator Dunn=01,s hearings with the Senate Select Committee=
 to
Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week.
This week and next week=01,s topics will be to go over previous investigati=
ons
into market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from:
Frank Wolak, Chairman Market Surveillance Committee, CAISO; Eric
Hildebrandt, Manager Market Monitoring, CAISO; and, Elaine Howle, State
Auditor.

--  The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week and
focused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before the
committee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso, commenting on the
rise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation and
collusion occurred.  The subcommittee plans on putting together a package o=
f
bills related to natural gas issues, which would be the culmination of the
committee=01,s hearings over the last two months.  This package will be up =
for
consideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee.

-- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of the
Calpine Metcalf Energy Center, the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for th=
e
San Jose region.  The Governor urged the CEC to approve the plant siting so
that construction can begin.

-- Two long-term contracting bills are scheduled for hearings next week.
IEP counsel is currently reviewing AB 57 (Wright) and SB 997 (Morrow) and
will comment on their provisions as soon as possible.

--  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both the
special session and regular session.  Please let me know if you need copies
of any of these bills.

Dear Chamber Members,

The time for you to make a difference is now!

We have only 10 days until we elect a new president and a new
Congress, and the U.S. Chamber needs your help.  The U.S.
Chamber of Commerce represents you - America's business
community - and now is when we can make a difference.

Helping to elect pro-business candidates is not something we
should take for granted. That's why the U.S. Chamber has been
working hard over the past few months to help pro-business
candidates get elected. We've endorsed these candidates,
campaigned on their behalf, donated to their campaigns, and,
most importantly, lent them the awesome reputation of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.

We now need your help to make sure we are successful on
November 7th.  Please take a moment now and visit the
Elections 2000 page on our web site.  This page can be
found by going to http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/.

Once there, click on Pro-Business Candidates and you will find a
list of the candidates we are actively campaigning for and
support along with information about their race.  After you select
a particular candidate, we have also made it possible for you to
contribute directly to selected campaigns by selecting Contribute
On-line Now!

I would also ask that you take a moment to read a recent op-ed by
U.S. Chamber CEO Tom Donohue.  This op-ed titled - Business
As the Target - highlights the attacks the business community is
under from anti-business candidates.  I also feel it underscores the
importance of helping to elect and voting for pro-business
candidates!

To read Mr. Donohue's op-ed, please click here -
http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/_Business+as+the+Target.htm

Or, to help elect pro-business candidates, please:

1. Visit http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/
2. Click on Pro-Business Candidates
3. Select the candidate you would like to support!
4. Make a contribution of $150, $100, $75, or $50 directly to their campaign!

Please feel free to email me if you have any questions or if I can be of
assistance to you.  And, thank you for helping us to elect candidates
who support business!

Sincerely,

Bill Miller
Political Director


P.S.  Please visit http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/, select a
pro-business candidate, and make a contribution directly to their
campaign.  Remember there are only 10 days left until the
election, so they need support from the business community now.

To:	Enron Transportation Services Everyone - All@ENRON
Subject:	Outstanding Invoices

Enron Transportation Services has 2115 outstanding invoices totaling nearly $8.5 million, which need coding and/or approval in the iPayit system.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, ETS employees need to do their part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors.  
 
If you purchase items that generate an invoice (including cell phones, pagers, etc.) or if you are responsible for coding and/or approving invoices, after you receive your e-mail notification, please log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action to process the invoice (s) .  
 
Because the invoice (s)  cannot be processed for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox, it's important to code/approve invoices within five (5) days of e-mail notification.  
 
I expect ETS to stay current on payment of ALL vendor invoices.  
 
I have approved invoices in the system and it's very to use.  We will continue to monitor the status of our accounts payable, and we expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.
 
If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Carolyn Centilli at 713-345-8496.   Password questions should be directed to the ISC help desk, 713-345-4727.
  
Thank you for your commitment to improving our accounts payable process and for paying our vendors on time.

I was tired of the ""softball"" subject line

out of the office and also out of town.  so, without further delay, i need to 
get some $money$ from you guys so we can get registered.  here then is the 
deal, i need $60 from each of you to cover the fee, game balls, new bats, and 
fees for a practice field.  i also need it fairly quickly, so sorry to pass 
on my deadlines to you guys, but hey payday is coming up.  you can send me a 
check at home which is
chris hartman

or you can call me at home at 503-296-0782 or at work at 503-273-0361 and we 
can make arrangements.  i will come by your house if i have to or if you guys 
want to meet me downtown for some happy hour we can do that to.  whatever it 
takes, and i will go out of my way to accomodate you.  once we are 
registered, i will then want to find out what people want to do as far as 
practices go.  since last years practices were such a rousing success (the 
best one had 6 people show up) i want to get your input so we dont waste time 
or money.  and i also want to do some batting cages.  anyways i'm getting 
ahead of myself, just show me the money.  and let me know if you have any 
questions.

I have a favor to ask.  Would you mind asking your team to email or phone me 
when they make a location change on a deal in sitara.  We had a case 
yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal 
and for the hedge.  The point was incorrect and a person in logistics 
corrected it.  The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the 
locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will 
then value the deal in the trader's book at mid.  If the locations are 
different, it will value the deal at the customer price.  This could 
potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L.  It does not seem 
pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing 
deal locations due to time constraints.  We will be more than happy to make 
the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first 
place when we calc our books.  I would greatly appreciate your groups help in 
cutting some of these issues off at the pass.  If you have any questions or 
concerns, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks.

The 2 products will be EPNG Socal Ehrenberg and PG&E Topock.  The reason why 
we need to make these restricted products is so that we can prohibit El Paso 
Merchant Energy from trading them.  The reason why we want to do this is that 
El Paso Merchant Energy is refusing to trade with us, the Western region, 
both on their online trading system, ICE, and also in the broker market.  We 
feel that this is the appropriate action to take in order to keep the playing 
field level.  I'm sure this will bring up some questions, which should be 
directed to our VP, Mike Grigsby, if further explanation is needed.  Again, 
the desk has just made the decision to trade the products in this way, and 
they are asking me to make sure that we have the ability to roll them out on 
eol by 2/28 at the latest.  Thanks for your help."

Michelle;
I have been working quite closely with Valeria these past few weeks on many difficult HR issues.  I wanted to let you know, that she is wonderful to work with.  Her calm, professional demeanor is a real asset in these times.  

Valeria has a difficult, but critical role here at Enron.  I consider her a true partner to my generalist duties.

Just wanted to let everyone know I started a new job last Friday:
    Pipeline Power Partners
    10000 Memorial Drive, Suite 200
    Houston, Texas 77024
    713-290-8762
I'm back working on compressor stations and gas storage projects with some
of the guys I worked with on the Columbia Gas Compressor station in '93-'94.
Note new email address also.

Barry called me last week about the well pump. It was not working and he had
tried everything he knew to do. We decided to call Western Water Well
Service in Conroe to check it out. Bottom line-it was beyond repair and we
had to replace at a cost of $765.52. When our tenant at the time took it
upon himself to dig a new well ($1500) he had them put in a real cheap
pump-so that's why it went out in a relatively short period of time. We now
have only $90 in the account so everyone needs to think about making a
contribution sometime soon. If you have a question, please call.

Conrad

Hi Sally

I think I'll be in EOL meetings on Thursday and probably won't be able to 
make lunch.

Can we schedule a meeting for Friday please.  Currently I have the whole day 
free so you pick a time which is convenient for you.  I shall book other 
meetings after I have heard back from you.

Friday won't work for me for lunch this week, but Thursday is open for me at

plan some time on the calendar for Thursday or Friday.  Let me know.   I will 
look forward to seeing you.

I received a phone call from Frank Van Ryn of Koch, concerning the letter 
that was sent to him on 6/19.  Frank has stated that Koch will be contacting 
Arco concerning the two contamination issues.  Apparently Koch has been 
indemnified by Arco for the mercury issue and possibly the hydrocabon issue 
at well.  In any event, Frank said that he would be getting back with me in a 
couple of weeks to present a plan and initiate the cleanup, but wanted to 
discuss the issue with Arco.
I will keep everyone apprised on the progress.  "

We need to forward the money from the Feb 2001 Brazos sale to Tenaska IV.  I 
am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand 
fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $1,143,484.53.  There is already a demand 
fee for Feb 2001 for $29,851.64, so I think we just need to change that to 
the new amount.  Let me know if you want to handle this differently.

Bob Eury is asking Ken to lend his name and encourage employee support for light rail. Rosie please confirm with Ken, but I think he should allow Bob Eury to use his name in support of the mainstreet light rail project campaign (yes on prop 1 and no on prop 3), but I would say no on employee support (attending rallies etc) right now.  We have too much to do right now.  Assuming he agrees, let Misha know. "

Dear Mark and Geir,

I ran the audit viewer for deal # 521304.1 sale to Reliant and Mark Guzman's 
name came up as the person who added the strip for HE 18- HE 19.  (that means 
Mark or Geir).  As this is on the verge of a real - time shift change and I 
can find no notes in either of your books regarding a sale to Reliant, could 
you both please look in your logs and notes and at the Inc sheets and tell me 
who did the deal and who at Reliant you spoke to.  They are not showing this 
purchase from us.   Please also advise if the deal is in but under a 
different counterparty so that we can make proper changes.

When you respond to this e-mail, please be sure to Cc: Joy Werner in Houston 
as this matter needs to be cleaned up ASAP.

Thanks,

Virginia

we had a great time.  ed knows a lot about wine and took us to a lot of
boutique wineries where we were in the proprietor's houses hanging out,
drinking wine with them.  it was awesome.  my favorites were pride mountain,
paloma, and guilliams.  they are all very small but make incredible wines.
the place we stayed was nice, nothing great.  we ate at La Trevigne, napa
valley grille, and bouchon.  they were all very good, la trevigne was by far
the best though.  had a lot of fun.  i'll pick you up thursday, are you
checking any bags?

Hi Jonathan -

E-mail is great.  I have copied Tori Wells on this also, as she works 
diligently on Dr. Lay's itineraries and Rob Bradley, who works on Dr. Lay's 
speeches.  We have virtually no information about the OECD Forum or the IEA 
Ministerial session except dates - May 15-16.  We have made reservations for 
Dr. & Mrs. Lay at the Bristol Hotel.  

We look forward to hearing from you.

Rosalee

Subject: for Rosalee - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial


Rosalee --  I was given your name by Bill Ramsay as the person responsible
for co-ordinating Mr Lay's participation at the May IEA Ministerial session.
From the IEA side, I have been tasked with the responsibility for
co-ordinating not only parts of the Ministerial session, but also the
preceding OECD Forum -- in both of which Mr. Lay is scheduled.

I am hoping to be in closer communication with you to walk through our
current planning for these meetings, and to make sure that all our i's are
dotted and t's are crossed as we move toward May.  Please let me know
whether e-mail or a telephone call would be best.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Jonathan Pershing

Can one of you attend a meeting at 2:00 that Ed McMichael has called to discuss the Financial Book status?  He may have some questions about the termination log.  The meeting is tentatively in the new building, 5th floor - you can check with Sara, she will also be attending.  I'm not feeling well and going home for the rest of the day.

Ken, I found your card with your email address  on it when I was sorting 
through 
my filing cabinet. I decided to say  ""Hi"". Tears still pop in my eyes when I 
think 
about your Dad he was so very special to me. For  my sake I wish he could 
have 
lived forever but for his sake I'm glad he  didn't. I kept working for Kelly 
Assisted Living for a year or more in family  practice clinics etc so I 
wouldn't get too attached
I guess. I then went to work  at Boone Hospital on the cardiology ward for 
about 
6 wks and decided I didn't like that. So I'm now working at a  nursing home 
in 
Salisbury -- and I like this better, other than they are too  short of help 
and I work 
a lot of hours. The old people are still my preference and I  must want to 
get involved 
with them and really know them. But your Dad will always be  the really 
special one.
I just wanted to say hi and thanks for giving me the  opportunity to take 
care of him.
Sincerely, Marilyn Hurt

I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase 
option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate 
notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
 
Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
participation agreement and the development and construction management 
agreement.  

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a ""release letter"" for the banks 
and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.

I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.


Thanks,

Kay

they're fine for non US & Canadian based products (including physical power)

Subject: Amerada-Hess Corporation

As an introduction:  The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out 
the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not 
all of the products it wants to trade).

When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved 
to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the 
European products, including specifically European physical power products 
(which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).

Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to 
check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the 
products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).

What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with 
respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap 
Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, 
which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone 
up for unless we really mean it.

So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian 
based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going 
to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down 
for European physical power.

Yep, the time zone glitch.  I think he was looking at all deals in the 
system.  I almost think we should deal with this April, and worry about the 
rest when it comes up.   Will and I are also kicking around making the only 
choice in deal entry PPT.  Let Enpower sort out the rest.  We can modify 
stuff on the strip level, but PPT would be the only choice in blotter and at 
the top of regular deal entry.

I'm unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at. 
The first one (scary!!) has notes in the comments section of each leg that 
say it was terminated on 9/30/98; however, there are still forward deal legs 
that haven't been killed or zeroed out. I don't think I could consider myself 
a deal control professional on this one - I'll need to talk to a trader. But 
let me know what you want me to look for in the remaining deals. Is this part 
of the time zone glitch?

We are going to hold the limits the same in this contract, and take the extra 
on the purchase on the replacement equipment.

The Unit Liability Amount for the Salmon Energy Agreement is currently
$14,103,675, yet Lee Johnson's e-mail (contained herein) indicates that
the price for Unit 28 is $15,769,725.  Looks like we may have to
increase the Maximum Liability Amount, Unit Liability Amount and the
payments under the payment schedule.  Let me know how what you think.

Units will be 19, 20, 23, 28 (no serial # on 28).  I think the amounts
and
pricing stays the same.

Kay,

Is Salmon LLC the Delta Power project?  The unit 25-28 prices are $
15,769,725 per unit.  Unit 28 Guaranteed Delivery Date (=ex-works ship
date)
is 31 December, 2001.  A unit serial number has not been assigned to
date.

I don't know how your business teams on LV and Delta agreements are
distributing pricing and want to show payment and termination schedules
between the 2 deals.  Maybe you can poll Steve Thome, Bill Williams and
Jake
Thomas to get these answers.

For Salmon, the performance values in Section 10 will be per the 24 unit
master contract.
I'm in New Orleans today, reachable via cell phone 713-823-2055.

Regards,

Lee

Tana, 

The Tradespark PC has been installed in EB3858D. I created a local account 
for all the lawyers to use to login, the userid is tradespark and the 
password is tradespark. Once they login, they will doubleclick on the 
tradespark icon on the desktop and will be at the tradespark login window. 
The userid should already be in place, but if not, it is netnrg3 and the 
password is espeed. That should get them into the tradespark system. Now, 
once Tradespark has come out with a version that is W2k compatible, we will 
install the application on each of their PC's for their convenience. Let me 
know if you need any further information. As always, I am here to help.

                                   Thanks,

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Bob didn't make it to the meeting but did leave a voice mail suggesting that 
rather than creating a separate GTC for the brokers we refer to the GTCs 
already online for regular customers and have them agree to be responsible 
for the liquidated damages that would be calculated under those terms if the 
deal falls through.

any news, please let me know.? I will be back in DC tomorrow, leaving SF 
about 3 p.m. today.? I am working on an ""as soon as possible"" assumption, but 
it will still be a few days before I have useful drafts for you to review.? 
But hopefully we are beyond the question phase.

Thanks for including me.  Congratulations on Emily.  I know that you and she 
will be getting used to one another over the next few weeks, and that sleep 
will definitely be a scarce commodity.  Those first few weeks can be both 
wonderful and terrible at the same time.  Savor the baby stage as much as you 
can, and before you know it Emily will be cooing and responding to you in a 
way that makes all of the sleepless nights just melt away.  Enjoy your new 
role as mom -- it is a wonderful, life-long experience!  --Sally

...the third time is a charm.  After 2 failed adoptions, God has blessed me 
with a beautiful daughter!  Emily Lyn was born on Saturday, July 8 at 11:18 
am in San Antonio.  She weighed 7 lbs. and measured 19 inches.  She is so 
tiny and has a head full of dark hair!  I brought her home last night at 8:30 
pm.  Our first 
night went well even if I didn't get any sleep.  It's going to take some time 
for me to get used to the noises she makes.  I must admit, there were
days when I never thought this would happen.  I appreciate all the kind words 
of encouragement many of you have shared over the last few years
as I have gone through this process, especially during the really low 
points.  I am truly blessed.
I will be out of the office for a while but feel free to stay in touch as I'm 
sure I'll be logging in often.  Also, if I left someone off the list here, 
please have them forgive me.  Remember, I'm working on 0 sleep.  Please feel 
free to pass this along to anyone I may have fogotten.  Thanks.
Dianne

Sally -

These are the steps that we have taken to insure that the positions the V@R 
engine picks up are correct:

1. Each book adm. now checks his/her own positions that are going into V@R,  
rather than just one check at  a consolidated level.
2. All regional controllers will receive a sheet at the end of the night, 
verifying that all books are officialized."

FYI.  I got this from mike late last week.  Any comments?  It looks very 
early in their development but Mike may want them to talk to a couple of 
people here about their site.  We need to be helpful if it will help his 
business.

Dan are you up to speed on this?  If not please call him and get his 
viewpoint as well.

Michael, I have the following comments to the Nodocero.com project.

Currently works as a platform where buyers and sellers agree on a price 
through an auction process (brokerage fee)
They aim at becoming a regulated market with standardised contracts. (subject 
to market and regulatory evolution)
Their value drivers are the ""Payment Guarantee"" (through an insurance 
company) and ""Backoffice"" (registration before regulatory authorities). None 
of these issues are definitely solved (no agreement with Insurance Co. and if 
any transaction is done now, all the backoffice procedures have to be done 
manually with their employees).
No technological partner yet. They have developed the web site platform (you 
can see it at www.nodocero.com), but I understand that they don't have the 
rest of the technological components required (database, operations, clearing 
system, other). 

Apart from this, I would consider the following issues:

Currently there is no regulated market for this sector of the economy 
(Argentina and the rest of Latin America). Therefore their idea of becoming 
one is good.
The competitors in this race are: Nodocero.com - aXesoEnergia.com - 
EnergyVex.com - Rofex (Rosario Futures Exchange) - other.
No competitor has yet taken an important lead in this race. aXesoEnergia.com 
is doing an important investment in marketing, but it currently works via an 
auction process and does not provide any further service like guarantee or 
backoffice.
One of the competitors will eventually succeed in becoming the reference 
market.
Nodocero.com has no strategic partner yet. (this could be taken as positive 
or negative)

The attached file is their business plan


Patrick

For Massachusetts Electric Company and Navajo Tribal Utility Authority:  
you'll notice they want to trade power and we're shutting them down.  Leslie 
has to call the counterparties and talk to them about their power status.  
They're not showing up on the FERC approved lists, so Leslie has to figure 
out how/if they can trade power.

In its first week, the ThinkBank's Idea Vault received more than 35 ideas 
from all over the world!  And those ideas aren't just sitting there -- oh, 
no.  Connections have been made, dialogues have been started, things are 
happening at the ThinkBank.   
What's your interest rate?  Come to the ThinkBank today.


Did you ask a question at the all-employee meeting last month that was not 
answered?  Take a look in eMeet.  We've posted responses to questions from 
the meeting, as well as another anonymous question to the Office of the 
Chairman.  See the ""Office of the Chairman"" category in eMeet.


Stop by the eSpeak Archives to see what was discussed in Cindy Olson's 
EnronOptions event.  Great questions, great answers.  They're all in the 
transcript on eSpeak."

Thank you for your fantastic responses to our reservations request.  There 
has been some confusion concerning the Dinner Only option.  If you are 
planning to spend the night, you do not need to respond to that option.  It 
is listed only for those who do not plan to spend the night.   

We are preparing name tags for all the employees invited to the HPL 
Anniversary Celebration.  Please email me with the name you would like to 
appear on your nametag, such as nicknames, etc.   If we do not hear from you 
by Wednesday, August 2, we will use the name as it appears in the list we 
acquired from HR.  Please print this memo for any employees who do not have 
access to email.

Thank you so much for your help."

Hey fellas,
 I'm not going to make it this weekend.  Too many obligations here in WF and too far to go.  Wish I could be there.  Y'all will have a blast.  Give Dave my best.

Email me at work, I check that one more often:  thomas.lahey@sheppard.af.mil

Take care, God Bless,

I think Paintball looks good.  

I think we should just all go to the store together and split the cost
of the alcohol.  

Also, maybe play some poker at the house at night.  Maybe everybody can
bring a few dollars for a house game.    

No preference on the cake.

Oh, Tommy are you coming to the party???

Luke, please give my address to Bridgett:

John -

Attached is the file of ENA Commercial Managers and above with supervisors and LTI unvested equity added.  We used an Enron stock price of $65 for the unvested equity.

Let me know if you need additional info.

To all:

Over the past few months, Energy Operations has formally established global 
standards.   Exception reporting will officially begin for the West Desk on 
Monday, November 20th.  The exception reporting around these standards will:
help us gauge our performance and highlight areas for improvement
better allocate resources to issue areas
ensure individual and global business controllers are up to date as to 
arising issues

To accomplish this, numerous requirements have been established.  The  
requirement that affects trading is as follows:

Transactions are recorded accurately and timely (completeness, accuracy)
Transactions are recorded with 100% accuracy and valued appropriately in an 
approved risk system for the applicable product
Transactions are input into Enpower or TAGG on date of trade (prior to calc)

HOW THIS AFFECTS WEST TRADERS:

The Risk group in Portland and Confirmations group in Houston will now begin 
reporting any exceptions to the above requirement on a daily basis.   Any 
deals entered late, incorrectly or changed after the calc will require full 
written explanation to the Global Risk Controls group (this includes trader 
name).  The materiality of the deal is not relevant, you can be written up 
for 1 MW deals or 200 MW deals.  The Global Risk Controls group is looking 
for flaws in the process, whether it be people-related or system related.  

This exception reporting begins on Monday.  Please come to the Risk group 
with any questions you may have, we would like the West Desk to appear on the 
exception report as infrequently as possible.  If you have any special deal 
types that you believe will be in violation of the above requirement, please 
notify Risk so we can communicate this to Global Risk Controls.

Thanks for your help in this matter,

West Risk

Mike,

How are things going? I trust that you are adjusting relatively easily. 

Things have been relatively quiet lately. Doing a little snowboarding and 
watching lots of movies. Trying to drag my lazy ass to the gym at least 4 
days a week. So far I'm at one in a row. Things are looking good for a repeat 
today.

Laird popped by today and brought us some lattes and saw the office. For all 
your hard work we are actually getting some term business done with Optimum 
now.
I think Lambie helped them out there.

Take care,

Chris"

In an earlier note this week, you receive information on Protocol Revision Subcommittee's (PRS) next meeting scheduled for January 28 -29, 2002 at ERCOT's Met Center.  Most of their two day agenda is to prioritize all the received system change requests.  RMS will have a number of  Texas SET representatives there and some companies are sending additional employees who are familiar with our Protocol Revision Requests (PRR).  Susan Neel, Texas SET Chair, will be our primary representative.  If you are sending additional representatives, please inform Susan who will be attending from your company. 
Subsequent to my earlier note, I received a request from the PRS Chair for RMS to collectively as a subcommittee, prioritized all RMS approved PRRs.  That list was to be submitted to PRS this afternoon.  I expressed my concerns to the PRS Chair of the short turn around time on this request (48 hours) and the challenges RMS voting members and RMS market participants will face in accomplishing this with such short notice.  Come to find out, PRS' see the PRR prioritization process as just getting started, with additional opportunities for RMS to provide input on our priorities.  Thus, no harm done for now by not prioritizing our PRRs.   
Susan Neel will provide us an update from this PRS meeting at our January 31st RMS meeting.  At that time, we may need to develop a process for RMS to prioritize its PRRs.

Dear Ken, 
I can understand Mrs. Bush's scheduling dilema.  We will move ahead and look into other speakers and or entertainers for the event with the ability to cancel in order to accomodate Mrs. Bush if she were able to attend.  We, as a committee would love to be able to announce that she is coming, but understand the need for security.  It is our hope and prayer that she would grace us with her presence, her wisdom, and her wealth of informatiom about education. 
I have emailed JHD and given him an idea I have to honor my dad in some way at the event because of his endless support in our school and his grandchildren.  I will let you know more about that as it develops.  My dad knows nothing about it so  I thought I could run it by John and he could give me sound advice.  I have big vision for our school and this community.  My dad taught me that.   
Thank you for everything you are trying to do for us.   
Sincerely, 
Barbara Collins"

 I expect that if Mel didn't examine these witnesses in their depositions, 
that they will certainly be called at trial.  Also, their testimony is 
consistent with Michael Goldstein's comments to me that I didn't understand 
the implications of the ruling on these facilities.
 Personally, I think that Platte's testimony that he didn't officially 
certify the capacity of the machines in 1998 and, therefore, their capacity 
is unknown, is sort of contrived and made-up sounding in light of the Rev 
Proc.and the miracle of hindsight. The Sempra representations to the IRS that 
the proposed changes would significantly increase production probably didn't 
mean increase it from 105 to 115 tons per hour. Also, Coston is going to have 
to explain what he meant when he made his representations to the IRS and I 
don't think he's going to lie under oath (maybe I'm naive). 
 Regardless of the preceding comments, it sounds like we probably need to 
talk to Tim W. about these issues and also probably need to talk to the K-M 
folks (through their lawyer) about this before the next round of depos. 
 On a related note, I spoke with Michael Goldstein on Tuesday about several 
issues.  First, I told him that if they were interested, we were interested 
in sitting down and talking about resolving things going forward.  I 
questioned whether they would have an open mind toward issues like moving the 
equipment.  He said that this would be up to Mr. Holmes but that he strongly 
doubted that ""repricing the deal"" or ""dramatically changing the economics"" of 
the deal would be acceptable.  I also asked whether he thought a mediation 
would be acceptable.  In response, he indicated that although he wouldn't 
rule it out, he thought it was premature. Finally, I mentioned that there had 
been some talk of deposing him.  He said that his only involvement in the 
negotiation phase of the project would be in connection with advice to Sempra 
and, therefore, these communications would be privileged.  He said he only 
met the Enron folks once before the documents were signed in August and this 
was supposedly a pretty casual meeting since he was allegedly busy doing 
other things. He also said that he had no involvement with the IRS PLR's. Let 
me know your thoughts about deposing him in light of this. 
 Finally, George is still out of town but as soon as he returns, I'll get 
with him to get out the letter I know that Greg is anxious that we send out. 
Thanks.

Subject: R.W. Beck Depos

Greg and Gail:

I've just completed the depositions of R.W. Beck, Sempra's independent
engineers on the Blue Grass/Somerset facilities.  Specifically, I deposed
Keith Platte all day Tuesday and deposed Lance Hardesty Wednesday morning.
The testimony was generally unfavorable to us.  In particular, I think they
require us to rethink our theory that the recent IRS Rev. Proc.'s places
limits on Sempra's ""lost tax credit"" damage claim.

As you know, IRS Rev. Proc. 2001-30 stated that ""a facility ... may be
relocated without affecting the availability of the credit if all essential
components of the facility are retained and the production capacity of the
relocated facility is not significantly increased at the new location.""  It
also stated that one of the conditions for obtaining a o 29 ruling is that
""[t]he treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressure
that results in briquettes, pellets, or an extruded fuel product, or the
taxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will not
significantly increase the production output of the facility over the
remainder of the period during which the o 29 credit is allowable.""  This
recent ruling from the IRS, of course, was inconsistent with Sempra's May
2000 PLR request, in which Richard Coston stated that ""[a]nother consequence
of the use of our emulsion binder is that less pressure is required in the
briquetting phase to produce a synthetic fuel with a significant chemical
change ....  Applying less pressure[s] causes two changes to occur in the
production process.  First a smaller percentage of the synthetic fuel will
be in the form of a briquette.  Second, output capacity can be significantly
increased.""

We know from the Enron agreements that Sempra sought to increase the
capacity of the Blue Grass/Somerset facilities combined to 2,000,000
tons/year.  If one assumes 24 hour/day operation for 360 days/year, each
machine would need to have a 115 ton/hour capacity to reach this level.
Keith Martin told us that the ""increase in capacity"" under Rev. Proc.
2001-30 should be measured against the capacity of the facility when it was
""placed in service"" prior to July 1, 1998.  As I told you a couple of weeks
ago, the Sempra Offering Memo contains a certificate from R.W. Beck that the
Blue Grass and Somerset facilities were ""placed in service"" on June 30,
1998.  In those certificates, Beck ""certified"" a capacity for each machine
of 50 tons/hour, which, for the 2 machines, means a max of 876,000
tons/year.  I concluded from this that, because Sempra's proposal to
increase Blue Grass/Somerset capacity by reducing the ""briquetting"" of the
output had been rejected by Rev. Proc. 2001-30, Sempra would not be able to
claim tax credits above those that could be produced at 50 tons/hour, and
that its damage claim would, at the very least, be capped at that level.

Keith Platte (pronounced ""Platty""), the lead engineer for Beck, and the guy
who signed the certification, poked a big hole in this conclusion.  Platte
is very personable (particularly for an engineer), appears to know his field
very well and, in my estimation, would make an excellent witness for Sempra,
should he be called.  (Mel did not question Platte.)  Regarding capacity,
Platte did not have a view as to the maximum capacity of the Blue Grass or
Enron facilities.  According to him, the Engineering, Procurement and
Construction (""EPC"") contracts pursuant to which the facilities were
constructed said that the facilities were designed to operate at 50
tons/hour.  Platte said that R.W. Beck's job was simply to certify that the
facilities had indeed been constructed by 6/30/98 in accordance with the EPC
contracts, meaning that, as of that date, the facilities had at least that
capacity.  Did they have a capacity of 75 tons/hour on 6/30/98?   He cannot
say, because he was not asked to and did not test that proposition.

I spent some time with Platte establishing that the capacity of a facility
cannot exceed the capacity limit of a particular component piece of
equipment in that facility.  He generally agreed with this fact, and that a
""slow"" piece of equipment could act as a ""bottleneck.""  I then tried to
establish the capacity limits for different pieces of equipment,
particularly the briquetter.  I got nowhere.  He fell back on the
proposition that, if he did not test it, he does not know the capacity
limits.  He said that, if I wanted to know the capacity limit of the
briquetter, I needed to talk to the briquetter manufacturer.  At the
conclusion of the deposition, I decided that that is what I would do.

I may still do that, but, after deposing Lance Hardesty today, I am less
confident that that would be a fruitful course of action.  Hardesty is not
nearly as good a witness as Platte; he has a kind of wimpy, limp-handshake,
dufus quality to him -- the kind of guy who was off in a corner playing with
a slide-rule when God was handing out personality.   Hardesty is, however, a
very knowledgeable engineer.  To cut to the chase, Hardesty 3 weeks ago
""re-certified"" the Blue Grass facility as it had been reconstructed back at
Somerset, using the original Somerset design (e.g., no screen before the
crusher, as it was designed at Norfolk).  Hardesty certified that the Blue
Grass facility had a capacity today of at least 105 tons/hour.  Most
significantly, I asked Hardesty -- who participated in the 6/30/98
certification -- to walk through an engineering plan of the facility from
June 1998 and to identify all the changes in facility components between
then and now.  There were not many, and he believes (Holmes will have to
confirm) that the significant components in the synfuel process -- the
mixer, the blender and the briquetter -- are all the same, albeit with some
modifications.  Thus, Sempra's argument will be that, if those components
were capable of producing 105 tons/hour in May 2001, they must have been
capable of doing so in June 1998, the date the facility was ""placed in
service.""

What about the modifications?  I asked Hardesty to identify all of them.
Holmes and Frank Ikerd told him that the paddles and the internal workings
of the mixer were changed somewhat.  The blender also had replaced some
internal pieces that wore out due to normal use.  (These things do not sound
significant to me, but an engineer or Keith Martin could convince me
otherwise.)  The briquetter is a different story.  Hardesty had earlier
admitted to me that the spacing between the briquetters is one of the things
that can affect the percentage of output that results in a briquette (think
of a piece of charcoal).  Because of significant operational problems in the
summer of 1998 (they kept breaking), the briquetters had to be reconfigured
at the direction of the manufacturer (Komar Industries).  Upon the
completion of these modifications, the briquetter rolls could be adjusted to
achieve spacing between the rolls of anywhere from 0.5"" to 1"".  (Believe it
or not, I know what this means.)  Hardesty said that, during his visit to
Somerset earlier this month, the briquetter was set at 0.5"" spacing and the
facility demonstrated a capacity of 90 tons/hour.  He then ran a capacity
test at 0.75"" spacing, and the facility demonstrated a capacity of 105
tons/hour.   I asked him how the capacities over what had been seen in June
1998 were achieved, and he said ""Certain improvements were made to the chute
feeding the briquetter and various transition points throughout the process
so that the material would flow better, in avoiding plugging.  But in June
of '98, we never attempted any sort of a maximum test; we merely tested for
the minimum EPC requirements of the EPC contract to install the facility.""
We then walked through each of the ""improvements.""  In short, other than the
changes to the briquetter, none of them struck me as the kind of thing that
would offend the IRS.

Focusing on the briquetter, I asked him why it had been set at 0.5"".  He
said that he was told by Holmes and Ikerd that that was the setting the
briquetter had after the modifications were completed in 1998.  (We'll need
to confirm this.)  I asked him whether he ran a test at the full 1"" spacing.
He did not.  According to Hardesty, ""[w]e discussed it with Richard Holmes,
Frank Ikerd and Richard Coston.  And for conservatism with regards to
maintaining the IRS placed-in-service ruling, three-quarter inch was
selected as a nominal setting for still making briquettes of a similar ...
size as we made on June 30 of 1998,"" and in roughly the same proportion of
briquettes to non-briquetted fines.  In other words, Sempra will argue to
the IRS that, while it has been able to increase capacity over the capacity
in 6/98, it has done so without omitting the briquetting requirement of Rev.
Proc. 2001-30.  Thus, Sempra's most recent PLR request will likely RETRACT
Coston's May 2000 statement that the increase in capacity comes at the
expense of briquetting.

Obviously, there is still some factual work to be done to see if Sempra's
new argument holds water.  For example, how do they prove what the percent
of briquettes to non-briquetted fines was in June 1998?  Also, we should
inspect the new facility at Somerset with our own engineer (we need to
retain one) so we can draw our own conclusions.  Finally, we will need to
grill Holmes on much of the foregoing, because he continues to be the person
with all the relevant knowledge.

In sum, while the Beck depositions did not generate good testimony, they at
least give us the tools to re-work our analysis on the possibility of using
Rev. Proc. 2001-30 to limit Sempra's lost tax credit damages.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Hello Rakesh and Gwen,
 
 
I am sorry that I have been out of pocket all week and did not have access to my e-mail.  I have just returned from NY and want to thank you for all of your hard work in helping us track the data.  You and your team have been extremely responsive in trying to get the information that we need.   I apologize for making numerous requests but everything that you have provided us will be useful to SSB.  
 
SSB has been provided with some information.  They will be incorporating the information that you have provided as well as information from the traders in their board presentations.  At this stage, I believe that we have done all that we can.  If I hear something further, I will let you know on Monday.
 
Again, thank you very much for all of your help.

Subject: Power and Gas Trading





Sarah, 

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

Subject: CES Storage

I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like 
to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several 
pipelines.  Who should I talk to?

On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and 
sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection 
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal 
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what 
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how 
to do it.

Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?

Ben,

I was again good to talk with you and I look forward to the
possibilities. As we spoke of, Joe Toussaint is heading up the talent
initiative and coordinating the recruiting process. I spoke with Joe
today and he informed me he had left several contact numbers for you so
I will at this point step out of the middle of process to allow for a
more coordinated approach. I'm sure I speak for Joe when I say we
believe the changes in the industry as well as Enron provide opportunity
for us both.

Please provide Joe with your resume as soon as you can and as we
discussed be prepared to discuss your desires, skills and/or experiences
you believe uniquely qualify you, as well as examples of your ability to
create value.

Again it has been my pleasure and I'm sure Joe or his designee will
contact you concerning your trip to Cincinnati and scheduled activities
next week.

I am not sure if they have confirmed either deal.  However, deal #1034254 was never pathed by us, whereas 1027152 was.  Therefore, nothing billed out under 1034254.

Bonnie - I am including you on this note in case you can add anything about the pathing of the two deals mentioned in this note.  Niether CMS orgaination shows anything on Trunkline that matches this.  We spoke briefly about this last week.

Phillip - I am including you in case you can add any clarity or determine who we did this deal(s) with.

Thank you,

Tom,

In contacting our scheduler and subsequently a CMS scheduler, neither CMS Field Services nor CMS Marketing, Services, and Trading are able to identify the deal.  Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don't even schedule any Trunkline deals.

Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.

They do not recognize that deal at all.

The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.  I have a confirmation on this deal with CMS.  However, it is not an executed copy (i.e. sent back or confirmed by CMS).  Is there some one who represented us with CMS on this that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  I will attempt to contact the scheduler in the mean time but any help would be good.

I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.

Folks,

Attached is a listing of retail shorts accrued to date.  The idea is to use 
our LM6000's, 6B's or Italian turbines to cover these positions.  Maybe we 
could sell the combination of shorts and machines to an IPP such as Calpine 
or AES who should be looking for earnings.  I would like to meet Friday at 
10:30 to plot out strategy and discuss the required analysis.  In the 
interim, please familiarise yourself with the data.

Attached please find a clean copy of the Enron South America Turbine
Facility Agreement, which incorporates the specific performance
guarantees that had been included in Exhibit U.   The attached blackline
shows these changes as well as those made by Rob Taylor.  I have run the
blackline against version 2, which was the last version that I had sent
to you.

We are still missing the Agreement Reference in Section 6.7.1.  I will
send the revised exhibits (i.e., without Exhibit U) momentarily.

We sincerely regret to inform you of a tragedy that occurred earlier today.  Cliff Baxter passed away this morning.  Cliff gave many years of dedicated service to the company and his spirit and wit will be remembered.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Cliff's wife, Carol, and his two children, J.C and Lauren.

We know many of you will want to do something for Cliff's family.  We will notify you as soon as possible about the Baxter's wishes."

Tino, attached is a spreadsheet with the info I think you need.  I got the 
publication wrong--its ""Megawatt Daily"" that posts daily prices.  Hope this 
is helpful.  DF 

Drew,

Attached is an excel file which contains pricing for the following delivery 
points January 1, 1999 through 
April 30, 2000:

 Four Corners
 Palo Verde
 Mead Nevada
 Southwest Power Pool

Let me know if you want any additional information.  We can get April 30, 
2000 to present information.  I just
have to call RDI--they put it out by quarter so at the end of July we will 
get the next disk.  They'll send me the
data if we need it.

Lorna

Friends:

This Saturday, November 3, I am participating in the American Heart Walk, a 5k and 10k walk that raises money for the American Heart Association.  I am sure that all of you are very familiar with the fine work of this organization, but if you are not, here is its website:  http://www.americanheart.org/.  Moreover, most of you are likely familiar with my particular interest in heart related charities.

I am looking for sponsors and would be very grateful if you could make a donation.  Please let know as soon as possible if you can help, since I would like to collect most of the donations prior to Saturday.  Also, for you Enron types, don't forget about the Matching Gift Fund.

Thank you very much for your support.

Jim Grace"

Governo cria conta para cobrir os riscos do setor
F?bia Prates, De Bras?lia
O governo anunciou ontem a cria??o de uma conta de compensa??o para remunerar, pela taxa Selic, parte
dos itens n?o gerenci?veis das tarifas de energia el?trica, agrupados na chamada Parcela A e que t?m
varia??o no intervalo dos reajustes tarif?rios anuais. A altera??o, que atende a um antigo pleito das
empresas do setor e regulamenta a MP 2.227, ? a primeira medida ap?s o racionamento que reduz o risco
regulat?rio das concess?es e que implica aumento nas tarifas, j? que antes esses componentes eram
repassados sem corre??o.
Al?m desses custos, as tarifas ser?o impactadas ainda por reajuste a ser concedido ?s distribuidoras de
energia - os percentuais est?o sendo definidos - e muito provavelmente em aumento tamb?m para a
gera??o, que ? aplicado sobre a distribui??o e, mais uma vez, chega ao consumidor final. As geradoras
pleiteiam reajuste como um caminho para compensar os custos da energia livre.
A Conta de ""Compensa??o de Varia??o de Valores de Itens da Parcela A"" abrigar? as varia??es do custo e
o transporte da tarifa de Itaipu, cotada em d?lar, a cota da Conta de Consumo de Combust?veis (CCC) -
subsidia as t?rmicas a diesel do sistema isolado -, as tarifas de uso das instala??es da rede b?sica e a
compensa??o financeira pela utiliza??o dos recursos h?dricos.
Os outros custos n?o gerenci?veis - energia dos contratos iniciais, Reserva Global de Revers?o (RGR), taxa
de fiscaliza??o de Servi?o de Energia El?trica e encargos de conex?o - n?o entram na conta, mas ter?o sua
corre??o concatenadas ? data de anivers?rio dos contratos das empresas.
As pr?prias distribuidoras administrar?o a conta e a Ag?ncia Nacional de Energia El?trica (Aneel), que
concede o reajuste tarif?rio, far? a fiscaliza??o. A conta de compensa??o passa a valer a partir de segunda-feira,
quando a portaria interministerial dos minist?rios da Fazenda e de Minas e Energia ser? publicada no
""Di?rio Oficial"" da Uni?o.
A concession?ria Light, pr?xima a ter reajuste, em 7 de novembro, n?o ser? beneficiada pela conta de
compensa??o, mas provavelmente ter? reajuste superior aos 21,78% solicitados, por causa da
concatena??o de parte dos custos com a data dos contratos. Outras 11 concession?rias ter?o as tarifas
reajustadas neste ano.
Jos? Guilherme Reis, secret?rio de Pol?tica Econ?mica, afirmou que a portaria se insere no aperfei?oamento
do marco regulat?rio do setor el?trico, cuja inten??o ? estimular investimentos no setor. A escolha da taxa
Selic, hoje em 19%, bem acima do IGP-M que corrige os demais custos, segundo ele ? ""uma contrapartida
pelo custo do dinheiro das empresas"".
Reis, o ministro Jos? Jorge e o superintendente da Aneel, C?sar Ant?nio Gon?alves, disseram n?o ter
estimativas de quanto essa remunera??o ir? impactar nas tarifas, pelo fato de os itens serem vari?veis. Os
custos da tarifa que ser?o contabilizados na conta de compensa??o representam em m?dia 27,2% das
tarifas das regi?es Sudeste e Centro-oeste, 22,7% da regi?o Sul, 10,2% da regi?o Nordeste e 8,2% da
regi?o Norte.
Gon?alves afirmou que a conta gr?fica e a concatena??o de custos esvaziar?o os pedidos de revis?es
extraordin?rias pelas empresas. As concession?rias tentavam recuperar a volatilidade dos custos n?o
gerenci?veis pedindo revis?o extraordin?ria ? Aneel, que negava na maioria das vezes. Muitas empresas
movem a??es na Justi?a tentando assegurar as corre??es.

I spoke with Clem and forwarded the attached guaranty.  I didn't read the 
guaranty so I don't know if it was negotiated or standard.  You should 
contact Clem about the urgent nature of the request as I am not familiar with

Hi Sara.  I'm sorry to bother with this, but I'm not sure who the appropriate 
para-legal is these days.  

Can you have someone send me an electronic copy of the ENA-CitibankN.A. ISDA 
contract?  I'm looking for the general trading contract and not the one used 
to confirm the one-off Yosemite structure.

Thanks Sara (or whoever ends up helping out).

Just for your information--this may highlight the reason for the difficulty 
for the East Region dividing its transportation usage tickets by contract 
number.  For the entire month of May, the Central region's transport p&l 
report is 20 pages long (and that's after splitting up transport tickets by 
contract number); the West report is 34 pages long; and the East + Market 
East report is 90 pages long without splitting transport tickets by contract 
number.  If the East began breaking up usage tickets by contract number, it 
could result in a five to seven fold increase in tickets.  

Any thoughts ?

This deal with Colorado River Commission is for calendar 2002.  We were told 
that we may need to enter special CAISO language for deals that extent past 
April 2002, but that the traders should be entering comments to indicate 
this.  Does Mike want us to include this language in the confirm letter for 
this deal?
Thanks for your help!

I was just thinking of the mountain of things going on, outside of normal stuff, and I decided to make a list. Here it is:

Formation of International Credit Group- Bradford/Murphy
Curve Validation Issue-Port/Gorte
Steel Issues-Bradford/Gorte
Rocar Progress/Implementation-Gorte
Operational Risk Metrics/Implementation-Curry
EES???-All
Bankruptcy Group-Gorte/Carson/Tribolet/Bradford
Retail Credit-Bradford/Carson
Private Equity Trading-Gorte
Credit Consistency study- Buy

I think we should have a meeting to discuss above. Some are bigger than others. Organization and website need to adapt to current business environment. 

If anything else belongs on this list let me know. Karen will set up meeting.

Kim -
I looked over the spreadsheet and I am available this afternoon around 2:00 PM and tomorrow afternoon.  Please let me know when you are available.  You may want to include Patti and/or Ann when we meet since they would drive any Sitara changes that will have to be made.

Janine,

Attached is a new spreadsheet detailing what Palo Alto's July invoice should include.  However, I would like to get together with you again to go over the information that you have and have some of the volumes in the system corrected.  Please give me a call when you are ready to work on this invoice and we can get together then.  I am available for the rest of the week.

Thanks,

Kim

Mark, Tom, and Holden,

In reference to the DPR impacts of $ 132,000 (WAPA) and $133,000 (SRP) that you were expecting, here is an explanation of why you will not be seeing that in your PMA's:

The 2 deals listed below were put in as a MW month, each with 3 strips in the deal separating out April 1, April 2, and the rest of the month.  The reason for the 3 strips was to catch the April 1 time change from PST to PDT.  

deal #  539126: 3 strips @ 2216 = 199,500 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $66,500).
deal #  538832: 3 strips @ 2180 = 196,200 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $65,400) .


Typically, I provide you with a report that tells you what $ amount to look for coming thru in your PMA's, according to the changes that I am making on the back end.  You then see the change in DPR come thru on a PMA report that Risk provides for you.  

When these deals hit Settlements, we recognized that the CARP was calculating both deals at 3 times their monthly value (and since we are purchasing, that is a negative three times against your books).  When the above + DPR impacts didn't come thru in your PMA's, we started looking at the deals to figure out why they didn't.


Here is a discription of the Risk - Settlements process:
Risk values a deal on the day of liquidation.  Any intra-month changes, even if they happen after the day of flow, get trued up by Risk and changed in the DPR.  Anything that gets changed after the end of the month, Settlements recognizes as a DPR variance and reports this to Risk and you see it affect your DPR as reported in the PMA report.

So the question was: When it came to recognizing a variance in Settlements, why weren't we seeing a + amount back to your books for 2 of the strips that I zero'd out? 

Houston Settlements looked into it and were seeing that these deals were originally valued at ($66,500) and ($65,400), even though CARP was showing that they were calculating at ($199,500) and ($196,200) ....

Heather Dunton and I did alot of searching for the answer and we found that:  When Risk flashed these deals in April, they flashed them according to a single MW month charge.  Regardless of how many strips there are, the deal is set up as a MW month and should, therefore, calculate as one single charge for the month. 

We found that CARP is reading these incorrectly and causing the confusion, (as I was seeing that the deals were calculating 3 times because that is how CARP and UNIFY were reading the deal). 

 The IT people in Houston are now working on fixing that glitch.

When it comes to DPR, your book originally recognized an impact of (66,500) and (65,400), which is correct.  Since your April DPR was correct, you will not see an adjustment in your PMA's.  

I recognize that this is not gratification for the + DPR impact that you were expecting and I apologize for the confusion and mis-information that I gave you in my report.  This has, however, helped us to hi-light a technical error that will save us alot of work in the future. 

Thanks for your patience while we figured this out.
Let me know if you have any questions.

 Thanks,

 Virginia

PLEASE E-MAIL RESPONSES TO: davise@southwestern.edu

Dear Southwestern Alumni,

My name is Brooke Davis, and I am taking an Organizational Communication class
at Southwestern University.  A large portion of the class is dedicated to an
intensive class group project centered on the University.  We will study
Southwestern as an organization and apply our research to relevant
Organizational Communication theories.  My class would like to enlist your
help
by asking you to complete the following survey:


How did you first hear about Southwestern?

What were your first impressions of the school?

How did those impressions/views change during the time you spent at
Southwestern?

Have your views about the school changed since you graduated?

Does Southwestern's rank in magazines and books affect how you see
Southwestern?  If so, how, and if not, why?

Are you actively involved with the school, and if so, how?

What do you like about Southwestern, and what would you like to improve?

Do you feel you have any control over what our campus looks like?  Why do you
feel this way?

Which building is the most important building on campus?  Why do you feel this
way?

The campus is continuously filled with more buildings made of
limestone.  Why do
you think the University chooses this type of building material for most all
buildings?

What type of image do you feel is tied into the way this campus has been
designed to look?

Describe the way the Southwestern campus looks in one word:

On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest), how important to the University is
aesthetic appearance?

What do you believe is the most important way alumni can be involved with the
University?

How do you feel Southwestern as an organization has changed since you
graduated?
Do you believe these changes are positive or negative and why?

How does the University keep you informed about campus events and
occurrences?
Do you feel the information you receive is sufficient?

How often do you visit the SU Web site?

Do you access the ""Alumni Home Page"" or the ""General Home Page""?

In general, what do you think of the Web site?

Specifically, what images or ideas do you think SU is trying to send to alumni
through the Web site?

What role do you feel you play at Southwestern?

What year did you graduate?

Additional Comments:



Please return responses to me via email at davise@southwestern.edu.  My class
and I greatly appreciate your help.

Sincerely,
Brooke Davis '03"

Subject: InterGen/ENA - GE Turbines & ABB Transformer

Attached are clean and redlined versions of revised drafts of (i) the
Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to CA
Energy Development I, LLC and the GE generator set, and (ii) the Letter
Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to the ABB
transformer.  The Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP
relating to CA Energy Development II, LLC and the GE generator set will
be in the same form as item (i) above with changes to reflect the proper
LLC.

To expedite matters, these revised drafts are being sent to you before
review by InterGen with the understanding that InterGen may have
additional changes and comments.

In addition to changes necessitated by the substitution of Sweetgum for
Tejas, the letter agreements have been revised to reflect the following
requirements of InterGen:

(i)  The parent guaranty on behalf of Sweetgum Energy LP has been
deleted;

(ii)  A mutual covenant requiring the Parties to use all reasonable
efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent as been added to the end of
Section 3; and

(iii)  A no shop clause on the part of ENA and its affiliates has been
added as  a new Section 17.

The reference to the TRY Ventures International agreement was deleted
from the letter agreement relating to the ABB transformer since it is my
understanding that the ABB transformer was not covered by Coral's
agreement with TRY.  ENA would nevertheless be protected by the general
language of the clause.

Although InterGen is still reviewing these documents for tax and other
concerns, for now the only contemplated changes to the LLC Agreements
and the GE and ABB acknowledgement letters are those needed to reflect
the substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas.

InterGen is still reviewing the Facility Agreement and exhibits
thereto.

I have passed on ENA's suggestion regarding the extension of the
closing date, but have not yet had a response from InterGen.

Doug Pedigo will be tied up tomorrow morning, but Doug and I are
available after lunch for a telephone conference to discuss any comments
you have on the closing.

George

Jeffrey,

We all have so much to thank God for! My wife and I will be away this coming 
week and so permit me to now take this opportunity to wish you and yours a 
truly great Thanksgiving holiday!

Our predictive dialer has evolved into a world-class computer-telephony 
server. Users may now easily add advanced inbound and call blending 
functionality, voice monitoring, voice recording, automated messaging, touch 
tone and interactive voice response (IVR), as well as email and web 
integration capabilities. And being all on the same box eliminates so many of 
the interface and support complexities associated with other alternatives.

Our strong growth and product enhancements continue unabated. Our 
network-wide Graphical Manager and Dynamic Campaign Builder (DCB) are setting 
entirely new thresholds of effectiveness and productivity! Also, we have just 
made yet another release of our Graphical Manager software and will now also 
shortly be releasing an even more expansive version of DCB.

We continue to add customer success profiles. You can view and print these 
(and others) from www.noblesys.com under 'Customers'.

Jeffrey, please advise whenever I can be of any assistance to you and/or your 
associates.

Again, Happy Thanksgiving!

Dan Donaldson

Mark,

Attached is an early draft of text for the proposed TransWestern Capacity 
Auction site.

I am sending it to you now only to give you a heads-up that this is in the 
works and is referred to in the document as a ""Transwestern"" Auction, as 
opposed to an Enron Auction.

Leonardo is the point man on this.

In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed ""Petitions for Rehearing.""
The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.
Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.
In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.
Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  
Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.
If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

""We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001.""  pp 20-21"

Chris,

I have several questions on these new product types.  Could you help me out so that I can send this for testing?

Is this the index for all products?   The Index shall be the settlement price for the last scheduled Trading Day of the NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract.
Which ones will be the locations you will be using?
Please match a Risk Book assignment to each location
Who will be the trader?
Who will be the risk book administrator?
What will be the terms trading? (start and end dates)


Please let me know when you get all this information.

		 Subject: Seismic Data on Oil & Gas field Development via Satellite

Mike,

Using NASA satellite transmission of maritime data and establishing a Houston 
Data Center to consolidate and centrally process 3D seismic data surveys for 
oil and gas extraction, exploration and development could save the petroleum 
industry more than $300 million dollars annually through reduced operational 
expenses.  Added value in shortening the time to process and deliver the 
finished surveys should generate more than $26 million per site (based upon 
$15/barrel for average oil well production to market 30 days sooner)in 
revenue.  By re-selling this data to market analysts or by internally using 
this data for forecasting future oil/gas production Enron could increase the 
accuracy of forecasting reserves and production capabilities globally.  By 
holding the data as exclusive (or partially exclusive), Enron would have a 
significant market advantage in futures pricing for oil and gas.(Vince's team 
is quantifying the valuation of this information)

Attached please find an updated version of the business case for seismic data 
transfer via satellite, by a geophysicist at SpaceData - William K. Aylor, 
calculated using $22/barrel oil.

Based upon your availability, Jon Adler and I would like to make a 
presentation to you (or your designated representative) on the Enron 
potential of this opportunity, sometime next week (17-20 October).

Notice No. 00-363
October 24, 2000

TO: All NYMEX Division Members
 All NYMEX Division Member Firms
 All NYMEX Division Clearing Firms

FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE: IRS Gives Exchange Favorable Private Letter Ruling on Demutualization=
=20
Transaction

The Internal Revenue Service yesterday gave the Exchange a favorable privat=
e=20
letter ruling notifying the Exchange that there would be no tax consequence=
s=20
to it or any of its members as a result of its demutualization.

This ruling was the final approval required for the demutualization of the=
=20
Exchange to take effect.  The plan was previously approved by the Securitie=
s=20
and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and a=20
97.5% majority of the Exchange members.

The demutualization plan, which calls for the equity in the Exchange to=20
remain with the seat-owners of its NYMEX Division, will make the Exchange t=
he=20
first in New York to convert from a not-for-profit membership structure to =
a=20
for-profit organization.

Yesterday=01,s approval is the final step in repositioning the Exchange as =
a=20
21st century business enterprise that will create and pursue profitable new=
=20
opportunities, react rapidly and decisively in an increasingly competitive=
=20
marketplace, and explore interest by outside investors. The Exchange expect=
s=20
to announce an effective date for the transaction shortly.

Once the demutualization is effective, the Exchange, a not-for-profit=20
membership corporation under New York law, will be reorganized as a=20
for-profit membership corporation under Delaware law and will be renamed Ne=
w=20
York Mercantile Exchange, Inc.  A new stock-holding company named NYMEX=20
Holdings, Inc., will be formed to own all of the economic interests and mos=
t=20
of the voting control in the for-profit membership corporation.  Each=20
existing NYMEX Division membership will be converted into one share of comm=
on=20
stock in NYMEX Holdings, representing equity in the overall organization, a=
nd=20
one membership in the Exchange representing trading privileges.

The common stock and trading privileges will not be separable until a=20
majority of stockholders vote to permit separate trading of the common stoc=
k=20
and trading rights.

All

Following discussions between Matt, Vince Kaminski, and me, Matt has decided 
he'd like to make a longer-term commitment to Research.  With this in mind 
we'd like to request that Matt is switched from A&A to the Specialist track.  
Vince and I feel this is clearly in the best interests of Enron given Matt's 
proven strengths in quant analysis.

How do we proceed?

All the best,

Subject: Re: using new FF vols  

Hi, John,
following up the discussion with you on Friday we talked with Risk Control 
people who are not excited to use that FF vol curve
you sent to me. Also in order to use your curves we would have to have them 
for all the locations.
The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol 
curves from historical data.
I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price 
curves for NG and 
all basis locations. I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor.
I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below. And here are the VAR numbers 
based on these curves:

     5/30/00  5/31/00
AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000
AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761
AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685
AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225

You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers. 
I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which 
would give more weight to recent data.
We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect 
backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor.

Tanya.

Tanya:
On Friday I emailed a new vol curve to use for VAR testing.  I was under the 
impression that you could apply this vol curve to the price book and storage 
book and have a new experimental VAR number by Monday. I have not received 
any response.  Please reply with status of this project.

Jeff,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to 
have
on the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The 
effort
of network design and construction currently under way is  unprecedented in 
terms
of its scope and complexity and it is important  for technical people, who 
often have
highly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.

I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) and
Saturday (April 29). I understand  that you have commitments on Thursday and 
Friday 
morning. We have reorganized the tentative agenda of the meeting to devote
Friday afternoon to more general topics.

Vince

I've gotten a bit more educated about IT revenue crediting since you asked 
your question yesterday.  ""IT revenue crediting"" is an industry term used to 
describe a requirement (brought about either by a FERC order or a rate case 
settlement) that IT revenues in excess of a certain dollar amount will be 
credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some 
refund mechanism.  Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue 
crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such 
obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the 
same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis. 

If you need more info, let's talk.

Jeff -- since most of Teddy's comments were over my head yesterday, I could 
use your help on that part of the discussion.

***
Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed TW Options filing, we opened the floor for questions and comments.  
Here is a summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  For example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, if ENA 
buys a call option it is essentially a free option.  ENA could buy a call out 
of the money and we could buy it back from them, with the proceeds going to 
Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned 
from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to 
credit the call money to other shippers.  BP's concern is that TW's filing 
will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service, so they 
want TW's options program to be as restricted as possible.  Dynegy reiterated 
its suggestion that the marketing affiliate be required to credit back the 
difference between the option fee paid by the affiliate and the next highest 
bidder's bid, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest bid by a 
certain percentage.  

Our response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing 
affiliate would be a concern, we feel that TW is entitled to a presumption 
that it has complied and will continue to comply with the rules on sale of 
capacity to marketing affiliates.  At this point we are not inclined to 
voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others 
have issues regarding Commission marketing affiliate policy in general, those 
issues should be addressed in a different proceeding that pertain to all 
interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  Our response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that options will constitute a 
negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  We did not 
respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's position at this point 
is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, the deals 
will only be negotiated rate deals if the total rate exceeds the maximum 
rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Several customers expressed concern that the options 
program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not 
clear why they thought that options would create more opportunity for 
hoarding than already exists.  Their perception was that options would simply 
make hoarding cheaper and easier.  We acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although we did not commit to 
placing any limits on the quantity of capacity for which a shipper may 
purchase an option, it is possible that FERC may require us to do so.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California to elicit their 
comments, and finalize the FERC filing by mid-September.

John

We are pleased to confirm today's launch of the following products via EOL:

Ethylene Contract (NW Europe)
Propylene Contract (NW Europe)
HD Polyethylene (German Film)
Polypropylene (German Inj)
Polystyrene (German General Purpose)

In a 2nd roll-out (timing TBC) we are looking to add:

PVC (German Pipe)
LD Polyethylene (German Film)
LLD Polyethylene (German C4)

We are initially offering 6 month and 12 month swaps for each product.

SUMMATION OF EUROPEAN MKT

- market is very conservative and tunnel-visioned, with derivatives as very 
new concept to all players (case of tail trying to wag the dog)

- even though no OTC trades have been done we are looking for the launch to 
act as a magnet for potential counterparties to at least start looking at our 
numbers on a regular basis (personalised letters + PR in industry mags is 
underway).

- Shell / BP are talking of launching similar platform 2001, but Enron only 
company aggressively marketing in Europe (look at 
http://www.eyeforchemicals.com/chem/presentations/hurley.pdf for Shell 
perspective).

- Enron brand is not known to converters/consumers  - profile awareness / 
promotion is continuous process.

- 6mo and 12mo prices are offered, as shorter term we are exposed due to the 
fact we are not in physical mkt.

- spreads are reasonably aggressive, but for hedging purposes all products 
show close correlation to each other and US equivalents.

regards
Rob Brewis

Morten, congratulations on the first power deal in Japan for Enron and the 
first power derivative transaction in Japan.

Mention should also be made of the significant support from Mike Grimes and 
Mark Crowther.

Mike lead a team that included legal, credit, accounting and tax, to put 
together a standard electricity purchase and sale agreement for Japan which 
was used as the basis for the NCC contract.

Mark played a large role in addressing the technical aspects of the NCC 
contract. He also had a significant role in the drafting of the Japanese 
version of the contract.

kind regards

		 Subject: NCC Power Deal - First electricity transaction

Dear all,

Enron Japan did today their first power transaction, and the first power 
derivative transaction ever in Japan. The counterpart is Nippon Chemi-Con 
Kabushiki Kaisha (NCC).

The term of the deal is 01/04/02-31/3/06, with a yearly volume of around 
110,000 MWh

The basic structure of the electricity transaction is that Enron Japan gives 
the counterpart a 6,8% discount on their actual electricity bill for the 
period 1/4/01-31/3/02. This discount, or the option premium, gives Enron the 
right but not the obligation to supply NCC with Electricity for the 4 yearly 
supply terms starting 1/4/02, 1/4/03, 1/4/04 and 1/4/05 at predefined prices. 
If Enron Japan decide to supply NCC with Electricity for a specific supply 
term, we need to inform them 2 months before the start of the supply term. 
This structure give Enron Japan the necessary flexibility to operate in a 
newly deregulated electricity market.

The deal was closed by Morten Erik Pettersen with very good support from 
Rousseau Anai (Associate Power Trading) and Jane McBride (Senior Legal 
Counsel)

Regards

Morten Erik Pettersen 
Head of Trading
Enron Japan Corp

Everyone,

Attached is the talking points for the Enron Overview.  Simon will send you 
the presentation.

Feel free to add to for your own presentations.  As long as we get the basics 
across, there is no problem with a little personalization.

Call me with any questions, or if you find data that does not seem correct.  
After this week, call Hamd - he's the new guy!

If this letter has not yet gone out, we should include the kitchen sink of 
perceived problems. I agree that the letter should be short, but lets 
eliminate their argument that we did not give complete notice.

Here's a first draft.  Please suggest any additional complaints/shortfalls 
which we need to raise.  It is better to be all inclusive than leave 
something out.



Richard, any ideas or comments?

can each day.  The plan of getting short for OCT bidweek no longer applies 
because of reduced basis risk in OCT basis.

Sara,

I have attached draft Confirmation of a Collar with Rand Whitney. They want 
to go live with this deal today and send out an executable Confirmation. 
Tanya wants to put a provision in the confirmation that states that the deal 
is subject to Credit approval. If we do not get credit approval Tanya will 
kill the deal. I have left a message with Tanya asking her exactly what she 
wants to say in the Confirmation. Please let me know what you think of the 
Collar the way it is writtne and if we have any language to use for the 
credit provision. I have a meeting at 3:00 an should be back at my desk by 
4:00. 


Thanks,

Jarrod

Vince-

I got your message (I was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the 
weather satellite dish- what a gorgeous view of Houston!).

I appreciate your words. Everything remains fine, Vince. You are my ""father"" 
here at Enron, and I admire and respect you greatly. I think I know the kind 
of person you are, in terms of your integrity, and I admire the high 
standards you set for all of us in your extended ""Group.""

I want to let you know I am not the only one in the group who doesn't 
appreciate the way Maureen disrespects you. You remain the key external 
factor in their success- it is not simply their own abilities that matter to 
their futures but your own- Vince's- success with upper management that 
matters.

We respect you, and we don't like it when you are disrespected. Maureen 
didn't disrespect me today, Vince, she disrespected you.

It's time I told you something. Last April, Maureen, highly intoxicated 
following a work-related function at Ninfa's, made an unsolicited predatory 
sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19th floor. I was shocked and 
disgusted, but I didn't say one word about this, Vince, because I played it 
out and didn't want to put you into the position of having a raving Maureen 
in your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of 
gender-bias crap lawsuits.

I ""took one for the team,"" Vince. I can'rt say I would do it again- Maureen 
is brazen to berate me after what she did, in public no less.

I appreciate your bringing me into Enron. I've found a respectful and, 
indeed, a loving work environment. I remain willing to do whatever I can to 
help the Group.

Clayton

What's the deal. No traffic all week. Makes coming to work really lame.

Here's something to talk about. Karnes City!!! Like it is time to cut checks
again and mail them to the opielas before they call me and hit me up for a
raise on our rent.

John:Last year looks like the break down was as follows: you wrote a ckedk
to Rancho Grande Trust for 2,600 and collected from Mark and Matt.
I wrote one for 900 and collected from pig, shet, smack, hudge and senior
saftey.

SO Brian, Chet, Chad, Hudge and Joe need to cut me a check for 150 a piece
and mail it to my office 815 walker #1447 H/T 77002.

If you are not interested in getting back on, let me know so I can fill your
spot.

John, mail your check and I will send off with mine and contract for emerick

Hi Tana

Thanks for the note.....!

I am looking for the original letter we signed with Glencore, but from my 
recollection, all we said to Gencore was that the choice of law under any 
master or other trading agreement between Enron and Glencore was unaffected 
by the choice of English law under the UK PA or ETA.  This of course is not 
quite the same as Glencore's view below!

Justin,

Per the email below, before we respond to Glencore we just wanted to make 
sure that you haven't made any agreements with Glencore with respect to 
choice of law for the online trades that would subject them to UK law.

I don't want to talk to them without checking with you first since this is 
one of the true counterparties that we are trading with on both sides of the 
Atlantic.

By the way, I heard you had some really good news.  I'm so happy for you!

Please see the email below - can you please look into Glencore's

law.

Hi,

I have received a call from Miriam in Glencore re EOL transactions.  Her 
concerned are that she does not receive the confirmations within 24 Hours 
(from Houston) of the deal being dealt which we are subject to in London and 
she would like to see this from ENA.  Also, when Glencore agreed to trade EOL 
transactions they stipulated that English law be used for all transactions, 
presuming these would be the same from ENA.  She has tried to call but only 
gets voice mail, could you please contact her to discuss these and any other 
issues she has with EOL.

Tel: 44 20 7412 3190

Debbie

Molly,

We would like to bring this student as a summer intern (the last one,
we are running out of space).

I shall send you another message regarding his proposed dates.

Thanks. I hope you have a very Happy Easter.

Subject: Re: Fact Sheet on Shareholder Proposal and Columbia Hills  

Friends---I'm in quite a rush to catch a flight, so keep that in mind if my 
comments aren't as articulate as we might prefer (though I did today again 
speak personally with Lauren by phone, Paula Reiker [by coincidence of 
meeting her alone in the elevator this morning], Steve Kean in person and 
Mark palmer several times in person about this since our conference call 
Friday. I think everyone has a good idea, first hand, of my thinking on this 
matter.

Let's be careful not to try to pit the alleged Yakimas intervening in this 
matter, against the ""real"" Tribe (even though we know there is divergence in 
their respective  thinkings and radicalism).  This delicate situation can be 
managed and I'm happy to handle it if needed. 
 Keep in mind that Tribes work like most of our dysfunctional families: 
you can tell me something bad about your mother and your brother can give me 
a better opinion about her;  if I don't like your mother and try to use you 
to defend my position against your brother, it's likely both you and your 
brother will team up against me.  ""sacred' grounds, even ""alleged 'sacred  
grounds' "" are somewhat moving targets and somewhat personal--no matter how 
wacky, one Indian wouldn't want to be put in a back-against-the-wall position 
of denying another Indian's claim of sacred grounds.  Yet again let me say, 
this situation between the groups is  manageable and I believe we can, when 
necessary, work with the ""real"" Tribe in the same, very amicable way we've 
been doing since 1997, to resolve this for the Wind Group should we ever 
decide to go forward.

Here's a red-lined version of my comments.

Thanks--I'll be travelling through Tuesday morning, but can be reached 
through all the usual alternative routes (phone mail is best--3-6117).

Thanks!!---Christie.

Our first Corporate Responsibility Task Force meeting will take place on 
Wednesday, October 25 from 10:30 am to 1:00 pm in the Enron Building - 50th 
floor boardroom.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could attend.  I think 
it would send a strong message on the importance of this initiative if you 
could drop by, even for a few minutes.  As you know, I will chair the 
meeting, assisted by Kelly Kimberly, Sr. VP of EBS, who heads our Corp 
Responsibility Initiative.

Thanks Ken"

MONTERREY, Mexico, Aug. 30, 2001 (Reuters) - Mexican paper company Grupo Industrial Durango (Gidusa) said on Thursday it will reopen a plant in western Mexico after ending a four-month-old labor dispute.
 The plant of affiliate Compania Industrial Atenquique was closed in April due to high labor costs, representing 25% of production compared with 8-10% at other plants. The plant produces 132,000 tonnes/yr of paper.

Attached are the latest drafts of 3 of the Cross-Guarantee agreements.  I 
have the other nine as well, in case you need them.  The agreements are 
basically identical with one exception.  The debt to Enron in Raptor 3 
(approx. $259MM) is excluded from the Guarantees.  You may also note that 
this debt is not represented on the DPRs which I sent earlier.  This is 
because the formation of Raptor 3 was a failed FAS 125 transaction, therefore 
we did not get sale treatment and can't recognize the debt in looking at 
credit capacity.  Let me know if you have questions or if you need the other 
nine guarantees.  Thanks,
Ron

Let's discuss Christain's cross-over date.  We have found a replacement and consider 8-10 weeks as a suitable period.  This would have him ending mid-December.
Let me know the best time to speak.

Subject: GCS Reservation charge Change (SoCalGas)

I have noticed we have not been beating the SoCalGas price.  As I 
investigated this further, it appears the SoCalGas Reservation Charge was 
changed as of 6/1/00.  Did you notice this?  I don't think I saw the changes 
reflected on the most recent Savings Analysis spreadsheet.  I have attached 
the 8/2000 Commercial Industrial Rate Schedules Summary.

Can you please give some feedback?  I want to know how this should be 
figured.  The last rate was based upon November's usage, divided by # of 
days.  

Thanks,

Denise

Pat Walke

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Pat Walke"

To EPLF and its sympathizers:   Unless the toaster is returned immediately,=
 SADIST will commence an escalating series of  actions designed to bring al=
l such terrorists to their knees.  We realize there may be some collateral =
damage, and for this we are truly sorry.  But we must end toaster terror fo=

e following series of actions (each subsequent action will commence 2 hours=
 after the preceeding sanction):
1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended
2. Napkins and paper towels will be removed from the kitchens
3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations
4. Paper towels will be removed from all bathrooms
5. Toilet paper will be removed from all bathrooms ( Enron stock certificat=
es will be issued for humanitarian reasons)

If the toaster still has not been returned, SADIST will be forced to remove=
 all COFFEE FILTERS from the building, including the Energizer and Plaza Ja=

It has come to the attention of the Dedicated Information Technology Progra=
mmers Addicted to Caffeine that we are somehow getting the short end of the=
 stick in these negotiations.  We are generally used to this, but this is t=
he last straw!  Being an often overlooked faction in these wars, we are how=
ever, very powerful.  Unless you provide us with the affricated drinks we r=
equire to survive, we will sabotage these negotiations.  We start by asking=
 the following questions:  What are your requirements for paper?  Have you =
documented these requirements.  What is the cost justification for ordering=
 this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these p=
rinters?  That will cost extra money.  What were the different requirements=
 surrounding your use of the toaster?  Do you toast bread and waffles?  Wha=
t other uses do you have for the toaster?  Anything not specifically includ=
ed in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and=
 will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster.

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-pac=
ks of 24-ounce bottles of the following:  Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, RC Cola=
, Jolt.  These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that =
they will be cold when we drink them in the morning.

Remember, paper without a working printer is the wrong print queue.  A toas=
ter without power is a metal storage box.  We have the power and will use i=

We have your toaster!!!  You'll get it back when our demands are met.
Leave 4 boxes of 8 1/2 x 11 paper (no damn 3 hole punch paper either)

Daren,

Please see deal 229758 for this matter.  I nominated this transport  for 5/10 to 5/16.  Should there be a deal there?

Daren,

The intercompany/interdesk reflects an error for the above referenced day.  A transport usage ticket was put into the system for 3,000 Dth (Duke Carthage to Texoma), however, we do not have any supply on EPGT from Duke for this deal.  The package was confirmed, according to POPS, so, we are probably missing the supply deal.  Please check on the day/price (it is the 3,000 on k# ta99027 on EPGT).  I am trying to take care of some of these current month issues on the ""clean reports"".

Mike,

Would you please make sure that this contract was nominated on EPGT for 5/10/01.

Thank you both for your assistance (everyone else is FYI),

Mary

Thanks for doing that. And those deals didn't show up in my query because I 
was looking for trades done under the Short Term West Services desk - I 
didn't realize Chris was also entering these under Short Term California. 
Just let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Thanks,

What about 573679, 579822, 579826 and the 2 transmission deals that are in 
Enpower?  I will change them as soon as Sam gets the CP set up if its okay 
with you.  Then I can tell Kim Hundle to resend the confirms.

Thanks for following up on this, Rhonda. I believe you just spoke with Chris 
about the executed original of this contract. Please let me know what else I 
can do to speed this process along. I ran a search for deals the West 
Services desk has done with this counterparty (which were entered with Sierra 
Pacific Industries, Inc.) and came up with only three deal numbers. They are:

580832
580137
580136

Would you like me to change these over? Or are you doing that along with the 
re-confirmation? Please let me know when you get a chance.

Thanks,
Kate

Because of credit reasons, the name above will remain the name under the 
contract.  Global Counterparty has agreed to set up this dba as listed on the 
contract.  Once this CP has been set up, I will need the trades moved to this 
CP and the deals will need to be reconfirmed in the accurate name.  

If there are no objections, I will move the deals and instruct the confirm 
person to resend the confirms.  I will also move the contract to this new 
name.  Genia will prepare the amendment covering just the change in the 
credit provisions.

If Portland holds the fully executed original, please forward to me at your 
earliest convenience.  If you have any questions or further instructions, 
please contact me at X35871.

 RTO Week

Day 3 -- October 17, 2001

Standardizing RTO Tariffs

The morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in RTO tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country.  There were many diverse views on the panel, and the Staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session.  

The panelists were:  Ricky Bittle, Arkansas Electric Coop; Jim Caldwell, American Wind; Peter Esposito, Dynegy; Rory McMinn, New Mexico PSC; Glenn Ross, Dominion Resources; Audrey Zibelman, XCEL Energy.

General Observations

This panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels.  Dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges FERC to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff.  Dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by FERC, noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years.  EXCEL has it's own focus - they want to be an ITC and want to provide many of the RTO services without being an RTO.  The Wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an ""as available"" basis.   The commissioner from New Mexico does not want standardization, does not want FERC stepping on the state's jurisdictional toes, and does not want New Mexico ratepayers' rates to go up.  Arkansas Electric Coop insists that SPP transmission capacity is full, so if competitors want to move power through SPP, new transmission must first be built.

I am somewhat concerned that some of the Commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary.  While the Dynegy concept had merit at one time, it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues, and it could take many months to go through the process, only to have FERC, in the end, decide the details anyway.  We may want to submit comments on this issue to FERC at the conclusion of RTO Week.

What Services Should be Standardized?

Overall, Dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized -- timing, confirmation processing, maintenance issues, bus names, ramping protocols, assumptions for ATC calculations, posting times, bumping rules, and settlement time.  With regard to congestion management, it should not be standardized between RTOs.  

XCEL does not support a standardized tariff but urges FERC to standardize some issues such as CBM calculations, reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties.  American Wind says FERC must focus on having liquid spot markets in RTOs and not worry about tariff standardization.  Dominion cautions FERC about Dynegy's proposal to let the industry work out the details.  He says this is what happened with Order No. 2000 and the industry was unable to work it out.  

Should FERC Retain CBM?

Ricky (Arkansas Coop) believes that the bigger the RTO, the less important CBM is because the RTO will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing.  Dynegy thinks CBM should be eliminated.  Dominion thinks CBM should be retained but the rules need to be changed.  CBM should not be set for a year - it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected.  Nor should CBM be standardized because needs vary region to region.  However, because CBM is used for load, the cost of CBM should be allocated to load.  All panelists agreed with the concept that if CBM is retained, load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff.

Network Versus Point to Point Service

Peter (Dynegy) discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point, similar to transportation service offered in gas -- firm and interruptible.  Peter suggests starting with the CRT tariff proposed several years ago.  Glenn (Dominion) thinks the CRT is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point.  

Should all Transmission Service Be Under the RTO's Tariff?

Most of the panelists said yes, all service should be under the tariff, but Ricky Bittle said there needs to be a transition period - minimum of 5 years, no more than 10 years.  Commissioner McMinn said no - he sees this as an infringement on the states' jurisdiction.

What Services Need to Be Changed Under a New RTO Tariff?

Jim (Wind) believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize ""as available"" resources.  Ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff.  XCEL urges FERC to recognize the distinction between RTOs and ITCs and allow ITCs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs.

Ray Alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on Cost Allocation.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Vince,

My phone is (650) 725-0541 (office).

I am still in a state of shock about Enron and I am still absorbing all the
news I can.  It is almost unbelievable to me that the company I worked for
this summer is now essentially kaput.

From the website I contacted you from, I take it that you are no longer with
Enron.  Please accept my deepest sympathies and best wishes in what must
surely be a difficult time.  I hope you were not as heavily invested in Enron
as many employees seemed to be.

I wanted to contact you regarding letters of recommendation.  I'm currently
looking for summer employment, in particular at network providers (such as
AT&T and IBM) as well as some financial institutions.  Would it be any
trouble for you to write a note on my behalf?  They may be requested via
email, so an actual letter may not be necessary.  I would have more details
later.

My best to you and your family and all those I knew this summer ---

Eric

Attached below is a complete copy of the CPUC's Order on SoCal's RLS Tariff for peaking rates for bypass customers.  There are some differences in the final order as opposed to the proposed decision previously issued such as the addition of an interruptible rate.  In summary the Order contains the following provisions:

1.  Two rates were adopted.  A firm cost-based peaking rate and an interruptible peaking rate.

2.  The firm cost-based peaking rate will include the following components:
	a.  A monthly customer charge to collect the cost of customer-related facilities. 
		Actual rate will be dependent on type of customer ranging from $800 to $19,000.
	b.  A volumetric Public Purpose Program surcharge based on Commission approved rates.
	c.  A monthly reservation rate calculated using the currently authorized end-use customer class rate times the MDQ.
	

3.  The interruptible peaking rate has been set at 150% of SoCalGas' default tariff rate at a 100% load factor.

4.  Firm and inter. customers will pay a volumetric rate to collect the Interstate Transition Cost Surcharge, Sempra-wide rate charge
     and any other similar types of surcharges.

5.  Other provisions include: customers are subject to daily balancing, interruptible customers are not eligible for Service Interruption
     Credits and the tariff will apply on a facility-by-facility basis.

SoCal was ordered to submit modified cost-based tariff sheets within 10 days of the order (Due 8/12/01).  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.  gh

HI.  I'm so overwhelmed at the goodness of God.  Know ye not that it's the 
goodness of God that leads a man to repent.  I feel like I just got a new 
boyfriend that I want to spend all my time with.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ok-Ok.  
I just wanted to share a scripture with you girls.  

Hebrews 4:12 - 
For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged 
sword, 
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints 
and 
marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

I'm so excited and encouraged to continue in this race.  I'm so thankful that 
God is teaching me through you and His Word that this race is not given to 
the swift, 
neither to strong but to the one that endures to the end.  Keep pressing my 
sisters!

Love You,

Dana"

You know all those credit card offers you get, offering great introductory 
rates with a balance transfer?  Forget them.  Introduce yourself to the 
ThinkBank instead.

Starting Friday, October 27, you can use ""Good Sense"" in the ThinkBank to 
find creativity resources, tips and techniques to make your job more 
fulfilling.  There is also a vault full of ideas from your fellow Enron 
employees.

The ThinkBank is committed to keeping your interest rate high.  When was the 
last time a credit card offer told you the truth about that?"

Carolyn,

In addition to the invoice change, the periods should be removed from
""LLC"" on the cover page, in the first paragraph of the first page, in
Section 1.78 and on the signature page of each Facility Agreement.  The
change relating to invoices is that the address of the invoices in
Section 6.7.2  should be as follows for one of the Facility Agreements:

CA Energy Development I, LLC
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P.
c/o InterGen North America L.P.
909 Fannin, Suite 2200
Houston, Texas 77010
Attention: John Jones
Fax: (713) 374-3901

and as follows for the other:

CA Energy Development II, LLC
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P.
c/o InterGen North America L.P.
909 Fannin, Suite 2200
Houston, Texas 77010
Attention: John Jones

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter."

Subject: Lake Temp. Affect Theory

A fact is this summer the NE never got very hot.  Therefore the 
Great Lakes didn't heat up as much as normal. Argument is then that 
the cool fronts might be colder to the NE actual temps b/c of winds off 
the colder Lakes.  
Does the lake affect snow theory cover this or would this be the infamous
Shively Windchill Effect I used to hear so much about when on Central ??
May be the reverse will happen, please enlighten me if you know something...

It might be interesting to take a look at the historical water temps. of great
lakes historical vs current year, may be the Enron depth of research can 
investigate.

Here is the link, I haven't had the time to do it yet....

Hmm.  Can you get a picture of the dog? Neil and I have been talking about 
getting Michael a dog, and we DO NOT want a puppy. Does she bark much?  Is 
she hyper? She's a short haired dog, isn't she?  

The problem with the document arose after you left yesterday, and I knew I 
had to get cracking on it early.  I would have had to ask you to be here by 
700, and I figure that was just too much to ask!  Thanks anyway.

I think he was feeling maybe he should do something, but he really didn't 
want to, and wanted my advice.  Well, I certainly gave it to him.

Kristine said an English Pointer showed up on her doorstep, and she's trying 
to find her a good home.  She said she's about 2, white teeth, trimmed nails, 
in very good shape and a great dog.  Know anyone looking for a pet.  I told 
her to let me know if she doesn't find anyone, but we travel so much.  She's 
an inside dog too.

You need to tell me if you get overwhelmed so I can help you if I can.

I'm in good shape now.  Just a little left for today.

Is Ric getting sentimental?  Losing someone can make you feel that way, even 
if it isn't logical.

We'll just get through this day and start over tomorrow.

Bruce probably hasn't heard from Nick yet.  I'll check again tomorrow.  When 
will you know when you are going to NY?  Sunday?

If you need help with a document, say something, I can help you (stay late 
whatever).  That's what I'm here for.  I figured something was up and I'm 
hormonal, so I've just stayed to myself today.

Ric emailed me about whether to pay his mother's, brother's and sister's way 
down for his birthday.  Now, he never hears from his sister and hardly ever 
hears from his brother except when he sends him his monthly payment that he 
owes him and that's just a check.  I told him to bring his mother down and 
the others can fend for themselves.  I was afraid I would hurt his feelings, 
but he said he felt the same way.  I will not have anyone taking advantage of 
him.  I'd be the same way with my brother if I never talked to him.  Emma 
wouldn't be nearly as spoiled as she is!!!!  Can you tell I'm hormonal, I'm 
just bitching away.  

Are you ok now with your document?

Sorry I was cranking this am.  I got here at 600am, mostly because I had 
problems with a document which had to go out today.

Have you heard from Bruce Silvers?  He called and left me a voicemail that he 
was free all day Monday, but he was checking with Nick Palatin.  I haven't 
heard any more from him and was wondering if he called you.  Just following 
up.

Jane,

you need to submit a request via the eRequest system.  (itcentral.enron.com)

Search for west power under ""applications"" and select general access, 
just note that you're in west gas.

That should do it.

Louise,

I spoke to our contact at BMO and they confirmed the $11.25MM is due to us by the end of day Wed. Also mentioned they were awaiting to have off-setting discussions with John Arnold.  Let me know if I need to put another call into them Wed.

Mark,

Have you received the Letter of Agreement from Gerald regarding the payment 
of the $2.8 to Transwestern?  If not, can you check on that please.  The 
funds will be wired on Monday, July 31.  I can use the invoice from 
Transwestern as support, but as for the monthly amortization, I need the 
'letter"" from Gerald for audit purposes.  

Thanks.

Steve the attached and two other e-mails to follow contain the most recent
draft of the NoCal IM. The SoCal IM should have a revised draft out
tomorrow.
 We are working with local counsel to develop a summary of the
regulatory framework affecting each asset and are having some difficulty
with response time. Does anyone in your group have an existing summary of
the regulatory framework in any of our target jurisdictions? Thanks Joe

Attached is the first of several pieces of the NoCal second draft.  The
numbers
attached are from the previous draft and do not represent our most recent
model
runs.  We spent all of Friday, Saturday and part of Sunday reviewing numbers
and
are still updating and finalizing models as well as matching facts and
figures
presented in the text to those assumed in the models.  We are going to spend
the
first half of this week finishing (hopefully) the modelling process and
putting
together MD&A's for each investment.

This draft would have gone out yesterday, but we heard from the SoCal team
in
London that the format of each asset description had changed and wanted to
at
least try to conform the NoCal draft to the altered format.  This is still
in
process at the writing of this E-Mail so that - in the interest of time - we
decided to get the text of the asset descriptions out now.  We understand
that
the new format is really just a reordering of the sections of each asset
description so conforming NoCal to SoCal should be fairly straightforward.

The intro Regional Strategy piece is being rewritten by Frank Sayre/Frank
Stabler and myself and will be circulated on Wednesday or Thursday.

In the interest of those who have to download in remote locations, I am
sending
the NoCal draft in multiple pieces.  A bound hard copy will be avilable
tomorrow
in Houston - let me know if you need one.

I would request comments back no later than Friday morning (Houston time),
so
that we can get them worked into the document over the weekend and have a
fighting chance of being ready to send the document early next week.

Many thanks,

Mark:
I'm looking forward to seeing you on the 21st and getting somewhat caught 
up.  I thought that it might be helpful to you to let you know what I have 
been thinking about in terms of work, although I would ask that you keep this 
confidential until we have had a chance to talk further and make some 
decisions.

First, if I do return to work, it will not be until sometime in January and 
you and I can talk about a date that makes sense.  I think that this is 
consistent with what we had talked about before I left.

Second, I would like for you to give some thought to the idea of me working 
part-time for a period of time.  Bill and I have talked about this alot, and 
I feel that I need some time at the outset to make the transition from what I 
have been doing to going back to work.  We can discuss further what this 
means, but I really feel that it would not be good for me or my family for me 
to start off working full time.

Next, I would like to talk with you about what my responsibilities would be 
in the swap group if I return and have a clearer understanding of the areas 
in which you would want me to work, particularly now that we have more 
people.     I know that alot of chnages have occurred in the last few months 
and I'm hoping that there are specific work areas that I could devote my 
attention to.

Those are my thoughts for now.  As for my office, I really don't care where 
it is or how large it is so just do what you need to do.  I hope that you are 
doing well and I'm really looking forward to seeing you.  I will bring 
pictures of Charles.  He is doing great!  Take care.

Dabhol and the do nothing Government

By Prem Shankar Jha

Ever since the Vajpayee's Government came to power more than two
and a half years ago, the economy has been sliding relentlessly
into the deepest recession it has ever known. In the nine months
since December industrial growth has averaged 1.7 per cent. The
decade when it averaged 9 per cent and the months, only five
years ago, when it touched 16.2 per cent, are now but a distant
memory. Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September 11
terrorist strikes in the U.S. It has now shrunk dramatically -
vehicle sales dropped by 20 percent in September and colour TV
sets registered a growth of a measly 3 to 4 per cent. With no
demand to power it, inflation, measured by the consumer price
index, has fallen almost to zero. The share market is dead and
there is no fresh investment. Employment in the organised sector
is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human
memory.

In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to
find a place, however humble, in the organised sector of the
economy but been turned away. By 2004, the number will have risen
by another three million. But Mr. Yashwant Sinha is confident
that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of
the country's problems.

But one recent event highlights the government's paralysis more
sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do. This is its
failure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of the
Maharashtra State Electricity Boards's attempt to foil Enron's
bid to take it before an international arbitration court by
claiming that a case was pending before an Indian court
challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase
agreement.

The London Court correctly maintained that just as a government's
international obligations as defined by the Treaty or the
agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law,
proceedings in an international court must take precedence over
those in a domestic court. The way has, therefore, been cleared
for India to face the humiliation of being dragged before an
international tribunal for a breach of it contractual
obligations.

Given the fearsome proficiency of Enron's lawyers, both those
whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase
agreement, it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEB
will lose the case. If that happens, then by a conservative
estimate, India will have to pay around $5 billion, in costs and
damages. In addition it will have to spend a little more to
complete phase II of the project. Thus in the end the project is
likely to cost not $3 billion but more like $5.2 to 5.4 billion.
For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has
dragged on, the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this was
simply a dispute between a State Government and a private
company, and it had no say in the matter. That pretext in any
case wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter-
guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues. But
today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because
neither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable,
let alone willing, to pay such an enormous penalty. So the bill
will, inevitably land at the Centre's door. And that means the
taxpayer's door.

The Centre will have no option but to pay. But having done so,
will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government? The
answer, obviously, is no. What it will be forced to do is
transfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to complete
and operate. But since no one can possibly run a $5 billion power
plant generating 2,100 MW of power profitably, the NTPC too will
insist on the capital value of the project being substantially
written down first. Judging from the offers that the Tata
Electric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply
Company (BSES) were making to Enron, the written down value will
not exceed $2 billion. Thus, whichever way we look at it, the
country will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant ($3
billion) without getting a single watt of electricity or for that
matter anything else) in return.

None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enron
probably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Rao
government agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis. Nor is
it intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government that
had it only brought the Maharashtra government and more
particularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginning
the latter's inability under law to pay backup charges at more
than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants
would have been exposed long ago.

But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify
even greater mistakes in the future. For better or for worse, the
Enron deal was struck, and it was struck not once but twice. As a
serious, responsible government that knows the importance of
honouring one's word in a world where contract is king, the
Vajpayee Government must honour the country's contractual
obligations. This does not in any way preclude its trying to
alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not
see, but by definition all future changes must be by mutual
consent.

The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhol's power
affordable, are known to all. As the 1995 Renegotiating Committee
and the Godbole Committee recommended, the Government should buy
the $800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into a
separate company that can supply gas to all the current and
future users on the west coast. In fact, it could go one better
and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage
the plant. This is entirely feasible because its installed
capacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need. This
will bring down the capital cost, upon which backup charges and
cost per unit of power will be calculated, to $2.2 billion.

Second, the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of the
equity in Dabhol from the promoters. This was negotiated with the
1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so.
This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign
exchange to $1.9 billion and the debt portion whose servicing
represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to $1.2 billion.

The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman
of BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee
debt. That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity
tariffs to changes in the exchange rate. With the price of oil
having fallen (for India) to around $20 a barrel, these changes
will bring down the cost of Dabhol's power at 90 per cent
capacity utilisation own to below Rs. 2.40 a unit. This will make
it entirely viable, especially if Maharashtra and the
neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the
average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and
reduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector.

The right course for the centre even at this late stage will be
to take over the project from the MSEB, renegotiate it with
Enron, or if Enron wants to opt out, then buy the project from it
at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before
handing it over to the NTPC. Getting dragged to court will
neither solve the problem of paying for Dabhol's power nor answer
the more basic question - how can any electricity grid add new
power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it
charges for electricity.
